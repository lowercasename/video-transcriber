[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:00 --> 0:00:04.160000]  So I'm just, I should have had a robot tell you that we're now recording.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:05.200000 --> 0:00:08.640000]  So you and I don't know how much your mum's told you about the study but I'm going to just

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:08.640000 --> 0:00:12.720000]  talk you through it now and like what will happen and then you can let me know if you want to

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:12.720000 --> 0:00:22.480000]  have a proceed with it. So I'll just start sharing my screen. Give me two sex and bring that up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:22.480000 --> 0:00:28.240000]  So can you see a document there? Yeah. Yeah, so I'm going to read out, but just in case you

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:28.240000 --> 0:00:32.880000]  prefer to read yourself. But essentially I go to a university in London and I'm part of a team

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:32.880000 --> 0:00:38.240000]  that are trying out this new game to help us understand parent and adolescent relationships

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:38.240000 --> 0:00:43.440000]  and communication. So in terms of what the study involves, essentially you'll play an online

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:43.440000 --> 0:00:48.240000]  game today with your mum for eight minutes. We're going to be using Zoom to record a video

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:48.240000 --> 0:00:52.960000]  of you playing. It doesn't require any game skill. The rules are very simple and I'll explain

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:53.360000 --> 0:00:58.720000]  to you both before we get started. In terms of the information you give us, so the video,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:58.720000 --> 0:01:03.360000]  like I said, it will be kept safe and secure and no one outside of the research team will see

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:03.360000 --> 0:01:07.360000]  the video. You don't have to take part. It's completely up to you and you can let me know if you

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:07.360000 --> 0:01:12.400000]  have any questions. If you do decide to take part, we can get going with the game now. If not,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:12.400000 --> 0:01:16.640000]  you can let me know. And if you decide sort of halfway free, you want to stop as well. You can

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:16.720000 --> 0:01:23.680000]  also do that. Are you happy to proceed? Yeah. Yeah, perfect. So I'll stop sharing my screen and

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:23.680000 --> 0:01:34.560000]  I'm now just going to put in the chat, the link to the game. Let me do six. So pop that in there now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:34.560000 --> 0:01:39.440000]  So if you can just open the link up and it should give you the option to either click keyboard

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:39.440000 --> 0:01:43.520000]  or touch screen and you can obviously click which one is applicable to you.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:50.240000 --> 0:01:56.320000]  Does that come up OK? Yeah. Yeah. And then are you able to share your screen with me again,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:56.320000 --> 0:02:00]  please? Yeah. Thank you.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:10.080000 --> 0:02:13.920000]  There you have it. If you go back onto zoom and then it should be at the bottom again.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:15.280000 --> 0:02:23.360000]  It's disappeared. What zoom is disappeared or you're there, but they say if you go

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:24.320000 --> 0:02:30.240000]  like on the top of your screen, is that can you see the zoom app or are you doing it through the

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:30.240000 --> 0:02:35.840000]  and through like your browser? I'm sorry. I got it. And we go got it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:35.840000 --> 0:02:40]  Got it. Yeah. And then if you can just share your screen, that'll be fab.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:40 --> 0:02:54.560000]  Perfect. So I think that's just coming through now. So yeah, brilliant. So you should be

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:54.560000 --> 0:02:59.280000]  able to see an edge of sketch on the screen. Have you guys seen an edge of sketch before?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:00.480000 --> 0:03:06.480000]  Yeah. Yeah. So it's basically the same as the physical one, but online. And essentially

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:07.440000 --> 0:03:14.320000]  we would like you to copy the picture you should see on the left. So the house onto edge of sketch

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:14.320000 --> 0:03:20.880000]  by working together. But there are some rules to it. So Liz, you can only draw lines a vertical.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:20.880000 --> 0:03:27.520000]  So up and down by pressing the O and the M keys. And then you and you can only make horizontal lines.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:27.520000 --> 0:03:33.920000]  So side by side by pressing the A and D keys. So I don't know if you're like the right way round.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:33.920000 --> 0:03:38.400000]  I think no, we're not. We want to stop, stop round.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:42 --> 0:03:46.560000]  There we go. And essentially the most important thing to remember is you can't touch each other's keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:48.480000 --> 0:03:55.520000]  So yeah, like I said, Liz, O and M keys and you and A and D keys. If you want to at any point,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:55.520000 --> 0:04:01.680000]  you can restart it. So there is a at the top right, there is a button, a new button.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:01.760000 --> 0:04:05.200000]  You should be able to see. And once you start drawing that will become like clickable.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:06.160000 --> 0:04:09.840000]  And you can get restart at any point. You're going to be playing for eight minutes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:11.040000 --> 0:04:15.440000]  If you do finish beforehand, if you can just like restart and play again, essentially we just

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:15.440000 --> 0:04:20.880000]  want you to be playing for the full eight minutes. If that's okay. I will turn my camera off

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:20.880000 --> 0:04:24.880000]  and my microphone off. So hopefully I won't distract. But if you have got any issues, just obviously

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:24.880000 --> 0:04:31.520000]  saying I can come back on. I'm going to get a timer up. And yeah, that's it. Do you sort of have any

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:31.520000 --> 0:04:37.440000]  questions? Or does it all make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I'll just get my timer ready.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:38.240000 --> 0:04:42.560000]  So yeah, like I said, I'll turn my camera off and then I'll come back on after the eight minutes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:43.200000 --> 0:04:45.040000]  So I'll press start now.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:04:55.360000 --> 0:04:57.360000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:12.800000 --> 0:05:14.400000]  Oh, is it not, is it not working?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:14.640000 --> 0:05:24.320000]  I think I've lost you guys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:34.560000 --> 0:05:38.080000]  Can you guys hear me? I can't hear you. Can you hear me?

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:05:38.720000 --> 0:05:42.960000]  Because I'm here. Oh, you're sort of cutting out a little bit.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:49.920000 --> 0:05:54.640000]  Oh, I think you're back now. I think it was sort of, it was cutting out. Is it not working the game?

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:05:55.280000 --> 0:05:59.040000]  This is internet connection is unstable. That's just the answer.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:59.600000 --> 0:06:03.360000]  Oh, you're back. You're back now. I can hear you now. So it's the game. It's a game not working.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:06:03.840000 --> 0:06:12.400000]  No, I'm pressing over. Have you tried like sort of using the mouse and click on like the middle of the

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:06:12.400000 --> 0:06:25.520000]  screen? And then try. I just make the noise. Oh, is it drawing? I think it's drawing now. I can see a line.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:06:26.160000 --> 0:06:30]  We can't see anything.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:06:30 --> 0:06:35.120000]  Oh, the dial things move, but we can't see any lines at all.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:06:35.120000 --> 0:06:42.160000]  That is weird. Maybe if we, if you go off the page and then re-click the link,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:06:43.440000 --> 0:06:47.440000]  I'm sorry about that. That's not happened before. So I'm not sure why it's done that.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:06:48.560000 --> 0:06:51.200000]  Yeah, maybe if you refresh it and see if that works.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:06:55.520000 --> 0:06:56.160000]  Yeah, it's working.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:07:00.800000 --> 0:07:07.200000]  Oh, you must. Yeah, let's say come off a bit and then.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:07:16.640000 --> 0:07:18.560000]  That was in the way. Maybe it's fun.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:07:18.560000 --> 0:07:19.360000]  All right. How about

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:07:58.360000 --> 0:08:00.360000]  Oh yeah, it's working now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:08:00.360000 --> 0:08:01.360000]  Yeah, it's working now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:08:01.360000 --> 0:08:04.360000]  Okay, well, if you can reshare your screen with me again,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:08:04.360000 --> 0:08:07.360000]  and then we can yeah restart it.
