[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:00 --> 0:00:10.280000]  should have had a robot say. So, Finnie, I don't know if you're almost told you much about

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:10.280000 --> 0:00:18]  the study already. No, that's fine. She's just volunteered you about 10 years.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:18 --> 0:00:23.560000]  I thought you'd be right through it, yeah. So I will get it up on the screen. I don't know

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:23.560000 --> 0:00:27.680000]  about you, but I find it easier to read something sometimes, but I will read out as well.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:27.680000 --> 0:00:37.680000]  So I'll just share my screen. Yeah, should be able to see my screen now. I'll just get this one up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:37.680000 --> 0:00:43.120000]  Oh, there we go. Fab. Yeah, well, I'm just going to read through it a little bit. So essentially,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:43.120000 --> 0:00:47.520000]  I go to university in London and I'm part of like a team of researchers that we're looking

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:47.520000 --> 0:00:52.240000]  into testing this new game that's hoping we hope will help us understand a little bit more

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:52.240000 --> 0:00:58.560000]  about pairing and adolescence, like teenagers, relationships and communication. So essentially,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:58.560000 --> 0:01:03.440000]  all you have to do today is play an online game with your mum for eight minutes. We're going to

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:03.440000 --> 0:01:09.440000]  use Zoom to record a video of you playing. The game doesn't require any gaming skill. The rules

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:09.440000 --> 0:01:14.800000]  are very simple and I'll explain them to you in a second. It's designed to be fun. So hopefully,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:14.800000 --> 0:01:19.920000]  yeah, it will be good. In terms of the information you give us today, so the video, like I said,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:19.920000 --> 0:01:24.880000]  it'll be kept safe and secure. No one outside of the research team will see it and we'd only tell

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:24.880000 --> 0:01:30.960000]  someone if we were worried about your safety, which I'm sure we're not going to be. So taking part,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:31.760000 --> 0:01:35.920000]  it's completely up to you. If you've got any questions, you can ask me before we start.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:36.960000 --> 0:01:41.600000]  If you do decide you'd like to take part, we can start now. If you don't, or maybe you decide sort

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:41.600000 --> 0:01:48.400000]  of halfway through the game, don't run anymore. You can stop at any time. Yeah, you're all up for it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:48.400000 --> 0:01:53.760000]  Yeah, yeah, perfect. So I'll stop sharing my screen now. And I'm now going to paste

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:54.480000 --> 0:02:04.560000]  into the chat the link of the game. Let's put that in the chat now. So if you're able to just

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:04.560000 --> 0:02:13.120000]  open that up. Yeah. And you should get an option that will say either choose between keyboard

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:13.120000 --> 0:02:17.520000]  and touch screen. Obviously, just choose which one applies to you. Oh, okay. What when you click on

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:17.520000 --> 0:02:21.600000]  the link, yeah, you click on the link, yeah, it should then give you the option to do keyboard or

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:21.600000 --> 0:02:27.600000]  touch screen. Okay, keyboard is on the laptop. There we go. Yep. Fab, brilliant. And then if you're

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:27.600000 --> 0:02:41.680000]  able to share your screen with me. I need to open up my card. I need to at least put this on

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:47.680000 --> 0:02:59.600000]  there. If you're going back on, so you're on zoom. Got it. Yeah, here we go. And then if you share the screen.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:03:03.600000 --> 0:03:09.200000]  There we go. Fab, yep. That's good. You can see that. Brilliant. And then, um,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:09.200000 --> 0:03:13.840000]  filling, are you sat on the left? Yeah, do we need to stop places?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:14.640000 --> 0:03:18.320000]  So yeah, so I think it's easier for these on the left, because with the keys that you're

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:18.320000 --> 0:03:21.600000]  going to use, I can't tell with the mirroring of zoom. That's okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:03:24.640000 --> 0:03:26]  You make sure this has got plenty. Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:29.920000 --> 0:03:37.840000]  All right. Can you reach it? All right. Yeah. Yeah. Fab, so brilliant. So this is extra

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:37.840000 --> 0:03:44.560000]  sketch. Have you ever seen the extra sketch toy before? Yeah. Yeah. You have won many years ago.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:03:44.560000 --> 0:03:51.920000]  Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. So it's basically the same as the toy online. And essentially,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:51.920000 --> 0:03:57.120000]  can you see the picture on the left? Yeah. What we're going to want you to copy onto the

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:57.120000 --> 0:04:02.400000]  extra sketch by working together. But there are a few rules to the game. So Gemma, you can only draw

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:02.400000 --> 0:04:07.760000]  lines that are vertical. So up and down and by pressing the O and M keys. And then finally,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:07.760000 --> 0:04:12.720000]  you can only make horizontal lines. So go inside by side by pressing A and D keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:13.920000 --> 0:04:16.800000]  But this, and this is important, you can't touch each other's keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:18.880000 --> 0:04:23.520000]  Remember, you can only touch your keys. If you want to any point, you can, if you see in the top

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:23.520000 --> 0:04:27.360000]  right corner, there's a new button. So once you start drawing, that will become like clickable.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:27.360000 --> 0:04:33.280000]  So if you do want to sort of start again, you can press new and it will refresh you.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:34.560000 --> 0:04:38.640000]  You'll have eight minutes to copy the image together. I'll meet myself and hide my video to

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:38.640000 --> 0:04:42.560000]  sort of avoid any distractions. But I am here if you need anything or have any issues.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:43.200000 --> 0:04:46.800000]  I'll speak to you to tell you when the time is up. And then that's the only part we use for

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:46.800000 --> 0:04:52.320000]  the research. And I'll stop recording at that point. Yeah. Is everything sort of clear, Javani? Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:52.320000 --> 0:04:54.800000]  Yeah. Yeah. No question.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:56 --> 0:05:00.480000]  Very good. Very good. So I think if you move your camera a little bit, Jami,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:00.480000 --> 0:05:05.840000]  you're not quite fully in the screen. They are perfect. Yeah, I think I've told you everything,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:05.840000 --> 0:05:11.920000]  I need to get worried that I'm going to forget something. I think, oh, that was it. Just again,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:11.920000 --> 0:05:15.440000]  we kind of want you to play for the full eight minutes. So if you do also finish the image,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:15.440000 --> 0:05:21.360000]  you can just start again and do it again. So I'm just going to get my time up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:23.040000 --> 0:05:27.760000]  Yeah. And then whenever you're ready to go, we can start. Ready? Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:27.760000 --> 0:05:29.600000]  And then you start there.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:39.840000 --> 0:05:45.280000]  Which part are you doing at the minute? So you're doing the, yeah, okay, that's fine.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:45.280000 --> 0:05:52.240000]  Yep. Okay. Yeah. Right. So then you want me to come down.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:54.400000 --> 0:05:59.200000]  Oh, no, that's the wrong way. End this down. Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:03.760000 --> 0:06:08.800000]  Then you're going to have to get back. That's it. It's going to be a very funny change

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:08.800000 --> 0:06:15.680000]  house, isn't it? Yeah. That's that right. Oh, yeah, we're done. Literally.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:17.680000 --> 0:06:24.320000]  Now, we can now do we do the same time. So which one, which one, which one, which

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:24.320000 --> 0:06:29.200000]  were we here? Are we going to play? Yeah, I was up. So ready? One, two, three.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:31.040000 --> 0:06:35.840000]  Look at that. Okay. We'll make it a flat roof, maybe. I'm ready. A bit further.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:36.640000 --> 0:06:46.720000]  And then I'll bookish and have a look. That's really funny. Shake, group. Do you want to try again?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:50.480000 --> 0:06:55.840000]  Do you want to try again? No. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. So where do we want to go now?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:56.400000 --> 0:07:03.120000]  Oh, like make the like ball. So where is the little thing? Where's the line at the moment?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:03.520000 --> 0:07:08.720000]  We need to come back down. Don't raise the bottom line. Then you need to go across.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:13.440000 --> 0:07:19.040000]  Now just leave it. I'll switch it. No, no, no, no, don't because there's stuff in there that

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:19.040000 --> 0:07:26.480000]  can't be washed there. And please leave it alone. So how do we do the window? I don't know,

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:26.480000 --> 0:07:32.640000]  maybe like a line. What you want to go across and then draw a window. That's going to be

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:32.640000 --> 0:07:36.560000]  really funny, isn't it? They can be square windows. You want to be square windows? I think you've

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:36.560000 --> 0:07:44.800000]  got to try and make them round. Where's your line going? I can't see it. Oh, there it is. Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:44.800000 --> 0:07:51.680000]  One, two, five. You need to come back. Back. Go back. I'm just going back into here, don't

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:52.240000 --> 0:07:59.200000]  worry. I know you can't. I'm not touching the bottom. No, you can't like go back on it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:08:00 --> 0:08:05.440000]  You need it needs to lie. Yeah, you can. Look, I'm almost doing it. Okay, so if we do that,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:05.440000 --> 0:08:12.480000]  what then across? Then you go across. Yeah. That. Whoa. And then if I go,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:12.480000 --> 0:08:25.120000]  you go across again. And then if I go down, you go across again. Whoa. You need to back up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:25.120000 --> 0:08:31.840000]  You need to reverse it. You need to reverse it. Yeah, no, I see. Yeah, no, that does work,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:31.840000 --> 0:08:41.040000]  doesn't it? I don't want to go too far now. Yeah, down. That's it. Yeah, down.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:41.040000 --> 0:08:46.400000]  Can't go down. Oh, no, I'm down. I'm like, yeah. And then you across. You want you to come back

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:46.400000 --> 0:08:54.640000]  to this bit? No, no, no, we need to go up. And then we need to do the paint across that side,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:54.880000 --> 0:09:00.800000]  don't you? Yeah, but you need to. Oh, I need to out. Yeah, okay. There you go.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:09:00.800000 --> 0:09:10.560000]  There's a year across. Oh, stop. And then go up to light there and then light across.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:12.080000 --> 0:09:14.320000]  Oh, I'm going down one. There you go.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:09:14.320000 --> 0:09:16]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:16 --> 0:09:24]  Oh, oh, oh, and then I'm going down. Whoa.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:38.720000 --> 0:09:42.240000]  I need to back up. That's nothing, don't you? Yeah, that you'll go on that down.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:42.960000 --> 0:09:45.200000]  I have done. It's here. We're here. Look.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:48.400000 --> 0:10:00.720000]  Now do it. Oh, that looks like traffic on. Okay, up and then down. Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:01.920000 --> 0:10:06.880000]  Okay, we need to try and put a little bit of chimney in here to make it look. Yeah. Okay,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:06.880000 --> 0:10:10.320000]  so far you need to get the chimney in the picture. Yeah, I know.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:11.440000 --> 0:10:14.480000]  So go across a bit more. Stop.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:10:16.960000 --> 0:10:17.360000]  Whoa.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:10:20.080000 --> 0:10:20.720000]  Why?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:22.080000 --> 0:10:24.320000]  I think you should keep it ever.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:26.080000 --> 0:10:27.920000]  You can go a bit higher and then you go across.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:29.600000 --> 0:10:36.400000]  Oh, I think you can make it in one cake. Oh, we're going to look at that house. Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:37.680000 --> 0:10:39.440000]  You want to try and do it for a while?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:40.160000 --> 0:10:43.280000]  Marry. We need to get a little bit of a minute.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:43.280000 --> 0:10:44.640000]  There needs to be a door hinge.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:44.640000 --> 0:10:45.920000]  Oh, they're going to open the door.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:45.920000 --> 0:10:46.800000]  There's no door hinge in that pit.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:46.800000 --> 0:10:48]  How are they going to open the door?

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:10:49.040000 --> 0:10:50.160000]  I'm going to do it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:54.720000 --> 0:10:59.600000]  Oh, we're going to be trying to straighten it out a bit.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:11:01.040000 --> 0:11:01.360000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:06.880000 --> 0:11:10.560000]  So where are you going?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:10.560000 --> 0:11:12.560000]  Which would need to go down on.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:12.560000 --> 0:11:13.920000]  No, you're not here.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:13.920000 --> 0:11:18.240000]  No, oh, it's what's this going to be?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:18.240000 --> 0:11:19.600000]  Door hinge.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:19.600000 --> 0:11:21.600000]  It's a really big door hinge.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:21.600000 --> 0:11:24.560000]  In the door.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:11:24.560000 --> 0:11:26.320000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:26.320000 --> 0:11:30.480000]  So, smile, that is interesting.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:30.480000 --> 0:11:32.480000]  It's almost like I got half the garage there, isn't it?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:32.480000 --> 0:11:33.280000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:33.280000 --> 0:11:40.480000]  So, if you use your arrays and go around the door,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:40.480000 --> 0:11:41.840000]  we can make a little, like, um,

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:11:42.880000 --> 0:11:43.200000]  frame.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:47.440000 --> 0:11:48.640000]  That's all hinge.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:48.640000 --> 0:11:50.880000]  So, that looks like a handle.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:50.880000 --> 0:11:51.760000]  Reverse it up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:51.760000 --> 0:11:53.040000]  It can be a handle.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:53.040000 --> 0:11:53.920000]  Reverse it up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:53.920000 --> 0:11:54.560000]  Reverse it up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:54.560000 --> 0:11:55.840000]  Reverse it up.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:11:55.840000 --> 0:11:56.160000]  Stop.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:11:56.720000 --> 0:11:58.720000]  Oh, long.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:04.720000 --> 0:12:08.960000]  I've got a little door hinge on that.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:08.960000 --> 0:12:09.520000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:09.520000 --> 0:12:10.720000]  Um,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:10.720000 --> 0:12:14.960000]  where should it look?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:14.960000 --> 0:12:15.760000]  Oh, there we go.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:15.760000 --> 0:12:16.640000]  Stop, stop, stop, then.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:16.640000 --> 0:12:17.200000]  And I'll go up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:17.200000 --> 0:12:19.680000]  I'm just going to put a little garage on the side.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:12:20.160000 --> 0:12:21.200000]  Oh.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:23.200000 --> 0:12:24.560000]  Nice.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:24.560000 --> 0:12:26.720000]  And then if we reverse it,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:26.720000 --> 0:12:28.640000]  if you go back and I'll go down there,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:28.640000 --> 0:12:29.600000]  we can put it going.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:32 --> 0:12:32.800000]  I shouldn't have that wrong.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:32.800000 --> 0:12:34.480000]  Complete, um, like, at the corner.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:34.480000 --> 0:12:34.800000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:35.760000 --> 0:12:36.560000]  Why don't go there?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:39.600000 --> 0:12:40.480000]  Then you go across.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:42.400000 --> 0:12:43.440000]  We have these.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:43.440000 --> 0:12:43.680000]  All right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:43.680000 --> 0:12:44.640000]  Stop, stop, stop, you know.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:44.640000 --> 0:12:46.240000]  Okay.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:12:52.240000 --> 0:12:52.960000]  Yep.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:52.960000 --> 0:12:54]  Back off.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:54 --> 0:12:55.040000]  Reverse it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:57.280000 --> 0:12:58.480000]  You should reverse it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:58.480000 --> 0:12:59.440000]  I can't.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:59.440000 --> 0:12:59.920000]  Why?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:00.960000 --> 0:13:01.920000]  Oh, yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:01.920000 --> 0:13:02.720000]  You can reverse.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:02.720000 --> 0:13:03.200000]  I can't.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:03.200000 --> 0:13:04]  I'm down.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:10.880000 --> 0:13:11.360000]  Wow.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:11.360000 --> 0:13:12.480000]  It was really nice.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:12.480000 --> 0:13:16.480000]  It's going to have a lovely look.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:22.240000 --> 0:13:23.280000]  I'm going to go back across again.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:23.280000 --> 0:13:24.960000]  That makes it my bold line at the bottom.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:24.960000 --> 0:13:27.120000]  So don't get why the chin needs a bit more blue luck.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:13:27.120000 --> 0:13:28.640000]  What did we get so wrong with chinning?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:13:29.360000 --> 0:13:30.640000]  Was it chinning?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:30.640000 --> 0:13:31.360000]  This is chinning.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:32.480000 --> 0:13:32.960000]  I can't believe it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:32.960000 --> 0:13:34.080000]  You put bedrooms up in there.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:36.480000 --> 0:13:38]  There isn't that lovely, that's right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:38 --> 0:13:38.320000]  Yeah.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:13:39.120000 --> 0:13:39.680000]  I'm going to see.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:13:39.760000 --> 0:13:40.160000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:13:40.160000 --> 0:13:41.760000]  So the eight minutes is up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:13:43.200000 --> 0:13:44.880000]  I'm going to stop the recording now.
