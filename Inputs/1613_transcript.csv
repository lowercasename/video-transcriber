text,speaker,start,end
 Yeah; you should have had a very book voice tell you that it's started recording.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:00,0:00:08
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:08,0:00:09
 So Emilia; I don't know how much of that has told you about the study; but I'm going to give you some information about it now.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:09,0:00:15
 And then you can let me know if you're okay with going ahead with it.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:15,0:00:19
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:19,0:00:20
 That's not good. Yes. I'll just share my screen.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:20,0:00:23
 Give me two seconds.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:23,0:00:25
 Okay. So you should be able to see my screen now.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:25,0:00:29
 Yeah; so I'm just going to read sort of read this out to you; but you can read it as well; if you like.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:29,0:00:33
 So essentially; as you probably know; I go to a university in London and I'm in a team looking at testing a new game that is we're hoping will help us understand parent and adolescent.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:33,0:00:44
 So children between the ages of 11 and 15; their relationships and communication.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:44,0:00:53
 The study will involve you playing an all my game with your dad today for eight minutes.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:53,0:00:59
 We're going to use zoom to record a video of you playing the game doesn't require any gaming skill.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:59,0:01:04
 The rules are very simple and I'll explain to you before we start.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:04,0:01:08
 In terms of the information you give us; like I said; the video will just be kept safe and secure and no one outside of the research team will see your video.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:08,0:01:17
 You don't have to take part. It's completely up to you. You can let me know if you've got any questions.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:17,0:01:21
 And yeah; if you do want to take part; we can get going.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:21,0:01:25
 Yeah; yeah; happy with it.,SPEAKER_01,0:01:25,0:01:28
 So I will stop sharing my screen now and I'm going to just put in the chat a link to the game.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:28,0:01:35
 Two seconds.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:35,0:01:38
 You want to do it there?,SPEAKER_03,0:01:38,0:01:41
 Yeah; right.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:41,0:01:44
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:44,0:01:47
 It is normally the kids doing it.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:47,0:01:52
 Yeah; and so you click keyboard or touch screen dependent on what device you're on.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:52,0:02:00
 Yeah; is that all opened up?,SPEAKER_00,0:02:00,0:02:04
 Yeah; and then you set on the left.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:04,0:02:10
 You're looking at the screen around the right.,SPEAKER_03,0:02:10,0:02:13
 So I think it'll be easier if she's sad.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:13,0:02:16
 So it's best if she sat on the right.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:16,0:02:21
 I can never tell with the zoom it sort of reverses it.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:21,0:02:28
 So we'll just be easier with the keys that you're going to be using.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:28,0:02:32
 Yeah; so I'm looking at the screen on the right hand side now.,SPEAKER_03,0:02:32,0:02:36
 So if I just talk you through sort of the rules.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:36,0:02:39
 So this is the edge of sketch.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:39,0:02:41
 Have you guys seen edge of sketch before?,SPEAKER_00,0:02:41,0:02:43
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_02,0:02:43,0:02:44
 Yeah; so it's basically the same; but online.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:44,0:02:47
 And you should be able to see a picture on the left.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:47,0:02:50
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:50,0:02:51
 Yeah; so we're going to like you to copy that picture onto the edge of sketch by working together.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:51,0:02:56
 But there are some rules.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:56,0:02:58
 Not hard.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:58,0:03:00
 Adam; you can only draw lines that are vertical.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:00,0:03:03
 You can just pop and down by pressing the O and M keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:03,0:03:06
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:06,0:03:07
 And then Amelia; you can only make horizontal lines.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:07,0:03:10
 So go inside by side by pressing the A and D keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:10,0:03:13
 And the important thing to remember is you're not allowed to touch each other's keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:13,0:03:17
 Oh.,SPEAKER_01,0:03:17,0:03:18
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:03:18,0:03:19
 So Adam; O and M keys and Amelia; A and D keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:19,0:03:23
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:23,0:03:24
 If you want to at any point; you can clear it and start over so there should be a.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:24,0:03:29
 That would be quite cool; actually.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:30,0:03:32
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:32,0:03:33
 But no; it's a bit more boring option.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:33,0:03:35
 So there's a bit of button at the top right.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:35,0:03:37
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:37,0:03:38
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:38,0:03:39
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:39,0:03:40
 That'll become clickable.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:40,0:03:41
 You'll play for eight minutes.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:41,0:03:42
 And I will meet myself; hide my videos.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:42,0:03:44
 So I won't hopefully distract you.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:44,0:03:46
 But I am here if you need anything.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:46,0:03:47
 If you got any.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:47,0:03:48
 If you are finished before the time is up.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:48,0:03:50
 If you can just sort of keep playing.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:50,0:03:52
 So just restart it again.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:52,0:03:53
 We just essentially want you to be playing for the full eight minutes.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:53,0:03:56
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:56,0:03:57
 I will speak to you to tell you when the time is up.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:57,0:03:59
 And then that's the only part we use for our research.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:59,0:04:01
 I'll stop recording at that point.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:01,0:04:03
 I always.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:03,0:04:04
 Is everything clear?,SPEAKER_00,0:04:04,0:04:05
 Do you have any questions?,SPEAKER_00,0:04:05,0:04:06
 No; it should be right to me.,SPEAKER_03,0:04:06,0:04:07
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:07,0:04:08
 Are you able to share your screen?,SPEAKER_00,0:04:08,0:04:11
 Just.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:11,0:04:12
 I'm a name; Amy.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:12,0:04:15
 Where is it?,SPEAKER_00,0:04:15,0:04:16
 You got to be on here.,SPEAKER_03,0:04:16,0:04:17
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:04:17,0:04:20
 So the bottom should be on zoom.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:20,0:04:25
 You go back on zoom.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:25,0:04:32
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:32,0:04:33
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:33,0:04:34
 And then at the bottom there should be the shadow.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:34,0:04:37
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:04:37,0:04:40
 We got it.,SPEAKER_02,0:04:40,0:04:41
 Got it.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:41,0:04:43
 Yeah.,UNKNOWN,0:04:43,0:04:45
 We're on.,SPEAKER_03,0:04:45,0:04:46
 Yep.,UNKNOWN,0:04:46,0:04:47
 And then you get to go back on the game.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:47,0:04:50
 Well; that.,SPEAKER_03,0:04:50,0:04:51
 So maybe take over.,SPEAKER_03,0:04:51,0:04:53
 I can't see.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:53,0:04:54
 I can't see you.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:54,0:04:56
 You can exit there with it.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:56,0:04:58
 Yeah; perfect.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:58,0:05:00
 Right.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:00,0:05:01
 So I'm going to get the time up.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:01,0:05:05
 You guys are ready to go.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:05,0:05:07

 They're down a bit first; right?,SPEAKER_02,0:05:53,0:05:55
