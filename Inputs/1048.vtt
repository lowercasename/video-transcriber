00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.415
Chloe Bilverstone: Okay, okay, that should now be recording

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:23.020
Chloe Bilverstone: perfect. So, Elizabeth, I don't know how much your mum has told you about the study, but I'm going to tell you a bit about it now, and you can let me know if you have any questions, and then let me know if you want to continue with the game. So I'm going to share my screen. Give me 2 seconds

3
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.530
Chloe Bilverstone: just to show you what I'm reading out. Where is it? Here we go.

4
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:48.590
Chloe Bilverstone: So I'm going to read it out, but it's also there if you want to read it as well. But essentially I go to university in London, and I'm part of a team looking into testing this new game that aims to help us understand parent and like Teenager, or, you know, just under teenager adolescent relationships and communication.

5
00:00:48.610 --> 00:01:13.529
Chloe Bilverstone: So in terms of your like involvement in the study, you'll play an online game today with your mom for 8 min. We're going to use Zoom to record the video of you playing. It doesn't require like any gaming skill, and I'll give you like the instructions before you get started. The rules are sort of very simple in terms of the information you give us. So the video, like I said, that will be kept safe and secure, and only me and the other researchers in the team will

6
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:26.889
Chloe Bilverstone: see that you don't have to take part. Like I said, Yeah, it's not compulsory. And yeah, if you've got any questions you can let me know. If you do want to take part, you can let me know now and then we can get started. Yeah, that's it, really. Do you.

7
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.209
joanna lyter: Yeah, we want to take part, don't we? Yeah.

8
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:41.570
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, you're okay, perfect. I'll just stop sharing my screen now. And I'm gonna put in the chat a link to the game. So just give me 2 seconds.

9
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.210
Chloe Bilverstone: Copy that in to the chat.

10
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.319
Chloe Bilverstone: so that should be there. Now, if you can open that up.

11
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.499
joanna lyter: You'll click it.

12
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.750
joanna lyter: He's here!

13
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.839
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, does that open? And they should get the option to either do keyboard or touch screen depending on.

14
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.210
joanna lyter: We haven't got a touch screen in.

15
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.700
Chloe Bilverstone: Okay, so, keyboard perfect.

16
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.909
Chloe Bilverstone: Does that all come up? Okay?

17
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.230
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. And you're able to share your screen.

18
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.090
joanna lyter: Yeah, we sharing no. Wait.

19
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.010
joanna lyter: Minimize this and then go down and share.

20
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.029
joanna lyter: Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.200
joanna lyter: Oh, how did she do that?

22
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.620
Chloe Bilverstone: Perfect.

23
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.430
joanna lyter: Okay.

24
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.099
Chloe Bilverstone: There we go. Yeah, brilliant. So. And then, Elizabeth, you sat on the left.

25
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.210
joanna lyter: Yeah.

26
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.640
Chloe Bilverstone: Yep.

27
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.450
joanna lyter: Oh, the right! She's on my right.

28
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.639
Chloe Bilverstone: Oh, so you so I think it should be easier if Elizabeth on the left. And then, Joe, you're on the right, just for the.

29
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.499
joanna lyter: You sit here.

30
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.687
Chloe Bilverstone: A little bit of a change.

31
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.640
Chloe Bilverstone: Music which has perfect.

32
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.569
Chloe Bilverstone: Yep, that's good, brilliant. So you should be able to see the etch-sketch in front of you. Have you guys seen an etch a sketch before.

33
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.280
joanna lyter: Yeah.

34
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.990
Chloe Bilverstone: Yes, it's basically the same as like the physical one. But online, and you should be able to see the picture on the left hand side.

35
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.280
joanna lyter: Yep.

36
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:26.709
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. So that's what we'd like you to copy onto the edge sketch by working together. But there is like a few rules which I'll talk you through now. So, Joe, you can only draw lines that are vertical. So up and down by pressing the O. And M. Keys.

37
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.330
Chloe Bilverstone: And then, Elizabeth, you can only make horizontal lines. So, going side by side by pressing the A and D keys.

38
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.220
Chloe Bilverstone: And but the most important thing to remember is, you're not allowed to touch each other each other's keys.

39
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:53.190
Chloe Bilverstone: and you must stick to your keys if you want to. At any point start again. There is a button you should be able to see at the top. That says new, and once you start sort of drawing it will become clickable, and that will sort of reset it. And you can start again

40
00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:21.319
Chloe Bilverstone: if you like finish sort of before the time is up. If you can just like start again. We basically just want you to be playing for the whole 8 min. If possible. I will put a timer on and I will mute myself and turn my camera off, so I won't like distract you, and I'll come back on after the 8 min. But I'm still here, like, if you need anything, or you've got any issues? And yeah, I think that's it. Really, does that all make sense.

41
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.940
joanna lyter: Yep.

42
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.380
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, perfect. So I'll get my timer up.

43
00:04:26.073 --> 00:04:29.540
Chloe Bilverstone: Do do. So it's gonna be 8 min.

44
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.910
Chloe Bilverstone: And yeah, are you guys ready to get started.

45
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.870
joanna lyter: Yeah.

46
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.599
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, perfect. I'll start it from now.

47
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.390
joanna lyter: I'll go down and do the door. Shall I?

48
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.419
joanna lyter: Okay, do you want to go that way?

49
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.450

109
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.340
joanna lyter: How are we? Gonna I think we should just go

110
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.970
joanna lyter: sort of here and then just go down and down.

111
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.859
joanna lyter: Yeah. But you know, we gotta make a perfect circle.

112
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.690
joanna lyter: Right? I ended in the house.

113
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:20.089

115
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.970
joanna lyter: let's deviate from the plan.

116
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:35.030
joanna lyter: Oh, and then go down halfway.

117
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.470
joanna lyter: That's me

118
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:48.970
joanna lyter: we'll do like, and it will cross, and then I'll go back to stop, and I'll go to the middle. And now you go that way, and then what that way.

119
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.970
joanna lyter: and then back the other way

120
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:56.070
joanna lyter: and go up. It's so exciting. Yeah, go up. Hang on!

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.589
joanna lyter: I'll go back up to the middle. Shall I? No. Are you gonna go. You do use square. Then

123
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.199
joanna lyter: should I go up? Go up

124

127
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.195
joanna lyter: Oh.

128
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:47.399
joanna lyter: that's not bad, though, is it? I mean, it's not great. Should we start again? Let's do another one. Okay.

129
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.099
joanna lyter: okay, how do you get it? Right? Let me start. Let me start.

130
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.590

131
00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.846
joanna lyter: Yeah. Oh.

132
