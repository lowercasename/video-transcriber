text,speaker,start,end
 So I'm just; I should have had a robot tell you that we're now recording.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:00,0:00:04.160000
 So you and I don't know how much your mum's told you about the study but I'm going to just,SPEAKER_00,0:00:05.200000,0:00:08.640000
 talk you through it now and like what will happen and then you can let me know if you want to,SPEAKER_00,0:00:08.640000,0:00:12.720000
 have a proceed with it. So I'll just start sharing my screen. Give me two sex and bring that up.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:12.720000,0:00:22.480000
 So can you see a document there? Yeah. Yeah; so I'm going to read out; but just in case you,SPEAKER_00,0:00:22.480000,0:00:28.240000
 prefer to read yourself. But essentially I go to a university in London and I'm part of a team,SPEAKER_00,0:00:28.240000,0:00:32.880000
 that are trying out this new game to help us understand parent and adolescent relationships,SPEAKER_00,0:00:32.880000,0:00:38.240000
 and communication. So in terms of what the study involves; essentially you'll play an online,SPEAKER_00,0:00:38.240000,0:00:43.440000
 game today with your mum for eight minutes. We're going to be using Zoom to record a video,SPEAKER_00,0:00:43.440000,0:00:48.240000
 of you playing. It doesn't require any game skill. The rules are very simple and I'll explain,SPEAKER_00,0:00:48.240000,0:00:52.960000
 to you both before we get started. In terms of the information you give us; so the video;,SPEAKER_00,0:00:53.360000,0:00:58.720000
 like I said; it will be kept safe and secure and no one outside of the research team will see,SPEAKER_00,0:00:58.720000,0:01:03.360000
 the video. You don't have to take part. It's completely up to you and you can let me know if you,SPEAKER_00,0:01:03.360000,0:01:07.360000
 have any questions. If you do decide to take part; we can get going with the game now. If not;,SPEAKER_00,0:01:07.360000,0:01:12.400000
 you can let me know. And if you decide sort of halfway free; you want to stop as well. You can,SPEAKER_00,0:01:12.400000,0:01:16.640000
 also do that. Are you happy to proceed? Yeah. Yeah; perfect. So I'll stop sharing my screen and,SPEAKER_00,0:01:16.720000,0:01:23.680000
 I'm now just going to put in the chat; the link to the game. Let me do six. So pop that in there now.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:23.680000,0:01:34.560000
 So if you can just open the link up and it should give you the option to either click keyboard,SPEAKER_00,0:01:34.560000,0:01:39.440000
 or touch screen and you can obviously click which one is applicable to you.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:39.440000,0:01:43.520000
 Does that come up OK? Yeah. Yeah. And then are you able to share your screen with me again;,SPEAKER_00,0:01:50.240000,0:01:56.320000
 please? Yeah. Thank you.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:56.320000,0:02:00
 There you have it. If you go back onto zoom and then it should be at the bottom again.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:10.080000,0:02:13.920000
 It's disappeared. What zoom is disappeared or you're there; but they say if you go,SPEAKER_00,0:02:15.280000,0:02:23.360000
 like on the top of your screen; is that can you see the zoom app or are you doing it through the,SPEAKER_00,0:02:24.320000,0:02:30.240000
 and through like your browser? I'm sorry. I got it. And we go got it.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:30.240000,0:02:35.840000
 Got it. Yeah. And then if you can just share your screen; that'll be fab.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:35.840000,0:02:40
 Perfect. So I think that's just coming through now. So yeah; brilliant. So you should be,SPEAKER_00,0:02:40,0:02:54.560000
 able to see an edge of sketch on the screen. Have you guys seen an edge of sketch before?,SPEAKER_00,0:02:54.560000,0:02:59.280000
 Yeah. Yeah. So it's basically the same as the physical one; but online. And essentially,SPEAKER_00,0:03:00.480000,0:03:06.480000
 we would like you to copy the picture you should see on the left. So the house onto edge of sketch,SPEAKER_00,0:03:07.440000,0:03:14.320000
 by working together. But there are some rules to it. So Liz; you can only draw lines a vertical.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:14.320000,0:03:20.880000
 So up and down by pressing the O and the M keys. And then you and you can only make horizontal lines.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:20.880000,0:03:27.520000
 So side by side by pressing the A and D keys. So I don't know if you're like the right way round.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:27.520000,0:03:33.920000
 I think no; we're not. We want to stop; stop round.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:33.920000,0:03:38.400000
 There we go. And essentially the most important thing to remember is you can't touch each other's keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:42,0:03:46.560000
 So yeah; like I said; Liz; O and M keys and you and A and D keys. If you want to at any point;,SPEAKER_00,0:03:48.480000,0:03:55.520000
 you can restart it. So there is a at the top right; there is a button; a new button.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:55.520000,0:04:01.680000
 You should be able to see. And once you start drawing that will become like clickable.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:01.760000,0:04:05.200000
 And you can get restart at any point. You're going to be playing for eight minutes.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:06.160000,0:04:09.840000
 If you do finish beforehand; if you can just like restart and play again; essentially we just,SPEAKER_00,0:04:11.040000,0:04:15.440000
 want you to be playing for the full eight minutes. If that's okay. I will turn my camera off,SPEAKER_00,0:04:15.440000,0:04:20.880000
 and my microphone off. So hopefully I won't distract. But if you have got any issues; just obviously,SPEAKER_00,0:04:20.880000,0:04:24.880000
 saying I can come back on. I'm going to get a timer up. And yeah; that's it. Do you sort of have any,SPEAKER_00,0:04:24.880000,0:04:31.520000
 questions? Or does it all make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay; I'll just get my timer ready.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:31.520000,0:04:37.440000
 So yeah; like I said; I'll turn my camera off and then I'll come back on after the eight minutes.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:38.240000,0:04:42.560000
 So I'll press start now.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:43.200000,0:04:45.040000
 Okay.,UNKNOWN,0:04:55.360000,0:04:57.360000
 Oh; is it not; is it not working?,SPEAKER_00,0:05:12.800000,0:05:14.400000
 I think I've lost you guys.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:14.640000,0:05:24.320000
 Can you guys hear me? I can't hear you. Can you hear me?,SPEAKER_00,0:05:34.560000,0:05:38.080000
 Because I'm here. Oh; you're sort of cutting out a little bit.,SPEAKER_03,0:05:38.720000,0:05:42.960000
 Oh; I think you're back now. I think it was sort of; it was cutting out. Is it not working the game?,SPEAKER_00,0:05:49.920000,0:05:54.640000
 This is internet connection is unstable. That's just the answer.,SPEAKER_03,0:05:55.280000,0:05:59.040000
 Oh; you're back. You're back now. I can hear you now. So it's the game. It's a game not working.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:59.600000,0:06:03.360000
 No; I'm pressing over. Have you tried like sort of using the mouse and click on like the middle of the,SPEAKER_00,0:06:03.840000,0:06:12.400000
 screen? And then try. I just make the noise. Oh; is it drawing? I think it's drawing now. I can see a line.,SPEAKER_00,0:06:12.400000,0:06:25.520000
 We can't see anything.,SPEAKER_03,0:06:26.160000,0:06:30
 Oh; the dial things move; but we can't see any lines at all.,SPEAKER_03,0:06:30,0:06:35.120000
 That is weird. Maybe if we; if you go off the page and then re-click the link;,SPEAKER_03,0:06:35.120000,0:06:42.160000
 I'm sorry about that. That's not happened before. So I'm not sure why it's done that.,SPEAKER_00,0:06:43.440000,0:06:47.440000
 Yeah; maybe if you refresh it and see if that works.,SPEAKER_00,0:06:48.560000,0:06:51.200000
 Yeah; it's working.,SPEAKER_03,0:06:55.520000,0:06:56.160000
 Oh; you must. Yeah; let's say come off a bit and then.,SPEAKER_03,0:07:00.800000,0:07:07.200000
 That was in the way. Maybe it's fun.,SPEAKER_03,0:07:16.640000,0:07:18.560000
 All right. How about,SPEAKER_03,0:07:18.560000,0:07:19.360000

 I'm not. I'm not. Again.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:33.040000,0:07:35.040000
 I hope it will work at this time; yeah; I'm not sure why.,SPEAKER_03,0:07:49.360000,0:07:58.360000
 Oh yeah; it's working now.,SPEAKER_03,0:07:58.360000,0:08:00.360000
 Yeah; it's working now.,SPEAKER_03,0:08:00.360000,0:08:01.360000
 Okay; well; if you can reshare your screen with me again;,SPEAKER_00,0:08:01.360000,0:08:04.360000
 and then we can yeah restart it.,SPEAKER_00,0:08:04.360000,0:08:07.360000
 Yeah; I don't know why that was must must have just been.,SPEAKER_00,0:08:07.360000,0:08:10.360000
 Yeah; messing up.,SPEAKER_00,0:08:10.360000,0:08:13.360000
 Okay; flat.,SPEAKER_00,0:08:13.360000,0:08:17.360000
 We'll reset the timer.,SPEAKER_00,0:08:17.360000,0:08:22.360000
 So if I just get the timer up; yeah; are you guys ready to go?,SPEAKER_00,0:08:22.360000,0:08:27.360000
 Yeah; yeah; okay; I've started it.,SPEAKER_00,0:08:27.360000,0:08:31.360000
 We're like; you're that door first; yeah.,SPEAKER_03,0:08:31.360000,0:08:36.360000
 Oh; what?,SPEAKER_03,0:08:36.360000,0:08:38.360000
