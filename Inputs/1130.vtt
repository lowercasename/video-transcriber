00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.204
Chloe Bilverstone: Should have had a robot saying

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.030
Chloe Bilverstone: so. Finley, I don't know if you almost told you much about the study already. No.

3
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.260
Chloe Bilverstone: she's just volunteered you about telling you.

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.920
Gemma Jameson: I thought you'd be all right for it. Yeah.

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:30.219
Chloe Bilverstone: So I will get up on the screen. Don't know about you, but I find it easier to read something sometimes, but I will read out as well. So I'll just share my screen.

6
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.160
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. Should be able to see my screen now, and I'll just get this one up.

7
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.049
Gemma Jameson: Oh, there we go!

8
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.620
Chloe Bilverstone: Fab.

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.450
Gemma Jameson: Yeah.

10
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:57.189
Chloe Bilverstone: So I'm just gonna yeah, read through it a little bit. So essentially, I go to university in London. And I'm part of like a team of researchers that we're looking into testing this new game. That's hoping, we hope will help us understand a little bit more about parent and adolescents like teenagers, relationships and communication.

11
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:22.169
Chloe Bilverstone: So essentially, all you'll have to do today is play an online game with your mum for 8 min. We're going to use zoom to record a video of you playing the game doesn't require any like gaming skill. The rules are very simple, and I'll explain them to you in a second. It's designed to be fun. So hopefully, yeah, it will be good in terms of the information you give us today. So the video, like I said, will be kept safe and secure. No one outside of the

12
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.209
Chloe Bilverstone: team will see it, and we'd only tell someone if we were worried about your safety, which I'm sure we're not going to be

13
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:45.830
Chloe Bilverstone: in terms of taking part. It's completely up to you, and if you've got any questions you can ask me before we start. If you do decide, you'd like to take part. We can start now if you don't, or if maybe you decide sort of halfway through the game. You don't want to play anymore. You can stop at any time.

14
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.310
Gemma Jameson: Opens up for the game.

15
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.719
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, you're all up for it. Yeah.

16
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.460
Gemma Jameson: Yeah, yeah.

17
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.800
Chloe Bilverstone: Perfect. So I'll stop sharing my screen now, and I'm now gonna paste into the chat, the link

18
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.080
Chloe Bilverstone: of the game in the chat now. So if you're able to just open that up.

19
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.720
Gemma Jameson: Yep.

20
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.429
Chloe Bilverstone: And you should get an option that will say, either choose between keyboard and touch screen. Obviously, just choose which one applies to you.

21
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.319
Gemma Jameson: Oh, okay. Well, when you click on the link, yeah.

22
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.900
Chloe Bilverstone: So you click on the link. Yeah, it should then give you the option to do keyboard or touch screen.

23
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.040
Gemma Jameson: Keyboard. Yes, on the laptop. There we go. Yeah.

24
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.919
Chloe Bilverstone: Fab brilliant. And then, if you're able to share your screen with me.

25
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.149
Gemma Jameson: And need to open that back up. Don't I

26
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.710
Gemma Jameson: hang on? I need to. I need to make this one big, and I don't know?

27
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.900
Gemma Jameson: Why would that?

28
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.260
Gemma Jameson: You know what hang on.

29
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.139
Chloe Bilverstone: If you go back on zoom, so are you on zoom.

30
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.850
Gemma Jameson: Hang on.

31
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.639
Gemma Jameson: Got it? Yeah. Here we go.

32
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.290
Chloe Bilverstone: And then, if you share the screen.

33
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.740
Gemma Jameson: There we go!

34
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.119
Chloe Bilverstone: Yep, that's good. I can see that brilliant. And then Philly, are you sat on the left.

35
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.270
Gemma Jameson: Yeah, do we need to stop places.

36
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:21.210
Chloe Bilverstone: So yeah. So I think it's easier. Finney's on the left. Because of the keys that you're gonna use. I can't tell with the mirroring of zoom.

37
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.990
Gemma Jameson: That's okay.

38
00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:24.070
Chloe Bilverstone: Which way you saw.

39
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.420
Gemma Jameson: Make sure this has got plenty of

40
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.579
Gemma Jameson: right. Can you reach it? All right?

41
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.700
Gemma Jameson: Yeah, yeah.

42
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.430
Chloe Bilverstone: Fab so

43
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.090
Chloe Bilverstone: brilliant. So this is. Etch a sketch. Have either of you seen the etch a sketch toy before?

44
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.080
Gemma Jameson: Yeah, you have one many years ago. Yeah.

45
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:54.209
Chloe Bilverstone: Really, yeah, yeah, so it's basically the same as the toy. But online. And essentially, can you see the picture on the left.

46
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.390
Gemma Jameson: Yeah.

47
00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:13.229
Chloe Bilverstone: What we're going to want you to copy onto the extra sketch by working together. But there are a few rules to the game. So, Gemma, you can only draw lines that are vertical. So up and down by pressing the O. And M. Keys, and then finally, you can only make horizontal lines. So going side by side by pressing A and d keys.

48
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.359
Chloe Bilverstone: But this and this is important. You can't touch each other's keys.

49
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:33.759
Chloe Bilverstone: Remember, you can only touch your keys if you want to, at any point you can. If you see in the top right corner there's a new button. So once you start drawing that will become like clickable. So if you do want to sort of start again, you can sort of press new and it will refresh it.

50
00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:51.949
Chloe Bilverstone: You'll have 8 min to copy the image together. I'll mute myself and hide my video to sort of avoid any distractions. But I am here. If you need anything or have any issues. I'll speak to you to tell you when the time is up, and then that's the only part we use for the research. And I'll stop recording at that point. Yeah, is everything sort of clear. Do you have any.

51
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.189
Gemma Jameson: Yeah, yeah, no questions.

52
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.770
Gemma Jameson: No, we're good.

53
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:08.500
Chloe Bilverstone: All good. So I think if you move your camera a little bit, Jeremy, not quite fully in the screen. There you go. Perfect. Yeah, I think I've told you everything I need to get worried that I'm gonna forget something.

54
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.100
Gemma Jameson: Yeah, okay.

55
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:26.229
Chloe Bilverstone: I think of. Oh, that was it. Just just again. We kind of want you to play for the full 8 min. So if you do also finish the image, you can just start again and do it again. So I'm just going to get my timer up. Yeah. And then whenever you're ready to go, we can start.

56
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.610
Gemma Jameson: Ready? Yeah, okay? And then you start, okay, miss.

57
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.970
Gemma Jameson: which part are you doing at the minute? Are you doing so you're doing the yeah, okay, that's fine. Yeah.

58
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.260
Gemma Jameson: yeah, right? So then you want me to come down those ones.

59
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.750
Gemma Jameson: Oh, no, that's not right.

60
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.500
Gemma Jameson: M is down.

61
00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.580
Gemma Jameson: Yeah. And I appreciate it.

62
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.670
Gemma Jameson: And you're gonna have to get back a call for me.

63
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.770
Gemma Jameson: That's it. It's gonna be a very funny shaped house, isn't it? Yeah, is that right?

64
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.520
Gemma Jameson: Oh, yeah. Well done, literally. Spot on.

65
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:29.590
Gemma Jameson: Now, if we both press them at the same time. So which one? Which one? Which way? Where are we? Here are we going that way? I was up so ready. 1, 2, 3.

66
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.209
Gemma Jameson: Oh, look at that! Okay, we'll make it a flat roof. Maybe everybody bit further.

67
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.549
Gemma Jameson: And then I've got push, M, haven't I?

68
00:06:43.168 --> 00:06:45.400
Gemma Jameson: That's really funny shape.

69
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.250
Gemma Jameson: Do you want to try again?

70
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.520
Gemma Jameson: Do you want to try again? No, we okay, all right, all right. All right.

71
00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.519
Gemma Jameson: Okay, so where do we want to go now? Oh, the like make the like ball. So where is the little thing?

72
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.469
Gemma Jameson: Where's the line at the moment?

73
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.320
Gemma Jameson: We need to come back down, don't we, to the bottom line and you need to go across.

74
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.110
Gemma Jameson: Not just leave arsenal, didn't they were?

75
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.959
Gemma Jameson: No, no, no, don't, because there's stuff in there that can't be washed. Erin. Please leave it alone.

76
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.430
Gemma Jameson: So how do we do the windows?

77
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.610
Gemma Jameson: I don't know. Maybe, like a line go like what you want to go across

78
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:37.709
Gemma Jameson: and then draw a window. That's gonna be really funny, isn't it? It can be square windows. You want to do square windows. I think you've got to try and make them round.

79
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.649
Gemma Jameson: Where where's your line gone? I can't see it.

80
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:49.580
Gemma Jameson: Oh, there it is. Okay. 1, 2, 4. I need to come back.

81
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.140
Gemma Jameson: Go back. I'll just come back into here, don't we?

82
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:59.609
Gemma Jameson: Oh, no, you you can't. I'm not touching a button. No, you can't like go back on it.

83
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.389
Gemma Jameson: You need. It leads to life.

84
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.670
Gemma Jameson: You can look so I'm almost doing it. Okay? So if we do that and then across.

85
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.270
Gemma Jameson: then you go across. Yeah, that Whoa?

86
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.500
Gemma Jameson: And then if I go, can you go across again?

87
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.420
Gemma Jameson: And then, if I go down, you go across again.

88
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.445
Gemma Jameson: Whoa!

89
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.659
Gemma Jameson: You need to back up. You need to reverse it.

90
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.620
Gemma Jameson: You need to reverse. Oh, yeah, no, I see? Yeah, no, that does work, doesn't it?

91
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.970
Gemma Jameson: Oh, I can't do far now.

92
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:43.680
Gemma Jameson: Yeah, down. That's it. Yeah, down. Can't go down. Oh, no, I'm down, aren't I, yeah.

93
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.310
Gemma Jameson: And then you'll cross. You're gonna come back to this bit. No. But then we need to go up.

94
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:55.480
Gemma Jameson: and then we need to do the pane of glass outside, though, don't you?

95
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.300
Gemma Jameson: Yeah. The unit? Oh, I need to. Up. Yeah, right? Okay.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.950
Gemma Jameson: So go across bit more. Stop.

111
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.760

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:36.723
Gemma Jameson: Oh, thank you! Oh, my good! Look at that house!

116
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.000
Gemma Jameson: Do you want to try and do a different one more.

117
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:48.469
Gemma Jameson: We need to do it again. We've got to do it for 8 min. There needs to be a door hinge. How are they going to? There's no door hinge in that picture. How are they going to open the door?

118
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.649
Gemma Jameson: I'm gonna say.

119
00:10:54.510 --> 00:11:00.480
Gemma Jameson: oh, Nope, what are we trying to straighten it up a bit? Go?

120
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.800
Gemma Jameson: Okay.

121
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:16.529
Gemma Jameson: where were you going? What do you want me to do? Go down? No, you're not here. No. Oh.

122
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.000
Gemma Jameson: so what's this gonna be opening?

123
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.860
Gemma Jameson: It's a really big door here in the truck in the door.

124
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:34.020
Gemma Jameson: Okay, so wow, that's it's interesting. It's almost like a half a garage there, isn't it? Yeah.

125
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.769
Gemma Jameson: So if you use your arrows and

126
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.570
Gemma Jameson: go around the door, we can make a little like fine

127
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:55.309
Gemma Jameson: ball hinge that looks more like a handle, reverse it up. It can be a handle, reverse it up, reverse it up reverse.

128
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.620
Gemma Jameson: Stop!

129
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.450
Gemma Jameson: Oh, no.

130
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.010
Gemma Jameson: I call it. 2 friend. Now.

131
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.689
Gemma Jameson: Where's your little thing? Oh, there we go! Stop! Stop! Stop then, and I'll go up.

132
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.850
Gemma Jameson: We'll just put a little carriage on the side nice.

133
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:29.949
Gemma Jameson: and then, if we reverse it, if you go back and I'll go down in there we could put a little gory.

134
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.260
Gemma Jameson: Why should it narrow. I can't see it at the corner. Okay?

135
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.999
Gemma Jameson: Why, then go there?

136
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.970
Gemma Jameson: Then you go cross.

137
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.400
Gemma Jameson: Are you happy?

138
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.030
Gemma Jameson: Stop! Be stopping, are you

139
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.920
Gemma Jameson: oops?

140
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.510
Gemma Jameson: Yep, back up, reverse it.

141
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.430
Gemma Jameson: We need to reverse it. I can't. Why.

142
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.530
Gemma Jameson: oh, yeah, you can reverse. I can't. I'm I'm down.

143
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.880
Gemma Jameson: Wow! It was drawing room to sketch. How lovely that!

144
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:27.040
Gemma Jameson: And then go back across again. It makes a nice bold line at the bottom. Just don't get. Why, the chimney's a bit wobbly up.

145
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.000
Gemma Jameson: How did we go so wrong on the chimney?

146
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.799
Gemma Jameson: Is this a chimney? Because it's a chimney

147
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.439
Gemma Jameson: you could put bedrooms up in there.

148
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.810
Gemma Jameson: There isn't that lovely? Yeah, trying to see.

149
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.190
Chloe Bilverstone: Okay. So the 8 min is up.

150
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.350
Chloe Bilverstone: I'm going to stop the recording now.
