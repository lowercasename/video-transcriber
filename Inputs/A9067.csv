 that we're doing. So we're a group of researchers. We work at UCL. And we're looking at interactions,SPEAKER_00,00:00:36,00:00:43
 between parents and their children. And that's what you guys will be taking part in today.,SPEAKER_00,00:00:43,00:50.8
 And the game that you guys are going to play takes about 10 minutes. So it's very quick.,SPEAKER_00,00:50.8,00:56.3
 And you don't need any gaming skills. So don't worry if; you know; maybe that's not something,SPEAKER_00,00:56.3,01:00.8
 you're super familiar with. And of course; the video I'm taking and all the data that,SPEAKER_00,01:00.8,01:07.1
 we get from you is going to be stored safely and securely. And no one will be able to,SPEAKER_00,01:07.1,01:11.4
 access it except our research team. Okay. Is that okay with you? Yeah; that's fine.,SPEAKER_00,01:11.4,01:21.9
 Okay; great. And just to mention; you don't have to take part today if you don't want to. It's,SPEAKER_00,01:21.9,01:27.2
 only if you want to. So just let me know if you're not comfortable. And you can always email me,SPEAKER_00,01:27.2,01:34.8
 after if you have any questions. And I think that's pretty much everything. Is that all clear for you?,SPEAKER_00,01:34.8,00:01:43
 Yeah; that's fine. Okay. And you'd like to take part in the study? Yeah; yeah.,SPEAKER_01,00:01:43,01:47.2
 Perfect. Thank you so much. I'll stop sharing.,SPEAKER_00,01:47.9,01:50.6
 All right. So for the game; I'm going to send you a quick link here in the Zoom chat.,SPEAKER_00,01:51.6,01:56.7
 And if you could click on the link and open it and then,SPEAKER_00,01:58.0,02:02.9
 share your screen with me; if you just give me one second; sorry.,SPEAKER_00,02:05.1,02:09.1
 All right; so you should see a link pop up now in the chat.,SPEAKER_00,02:17.2,02:43.4
 Okay; yeah. Is that coming up? Okay. And are you able to share your screen with me?,SPEAKER_01,02:47.9,02:56.1
 If it's; I think I've given you permission to share a screen.,SPEAKER_00,03:01.4,03:04.5
 Yeah; that's perfect. All right. So for this game; it makes the most sense if Charlie;,SPEAKER_00,03:07.5,03:16.3
 if you sit on the left of your mom; which I think you are mirrored; so I think you are.,SPEAKER_00,03:16.3,03:20.4
 And yeah; now that it's set up; this is called an Etch's Catch. Are you either of you familiar,SPEAKER_00,03:23.3,03:29.3
 with this game? You might have played it when you were younger; but the physical version?,SPEAKER_00,03:29.3,00:03:33
 Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Nice. That's great. Okay. So for today's rules is you see a little picture of,SPEAKER_01,03:34.2,03:42.0
 a house on the left side. It might be on your right side. Yeah. And the goal is for you guys to,SPEAKER_00,03:42.0,03:47.2
 copy the picture of the house onto the Etch's Catch. However; to make it a little bit more exciting;,SPEAKER_00,03:47.2,03:53.2
 mom; you can draw lines only on the vertical. So on your keyboard; you can use O and M keys.,SPEAKER_00,03:53.9,04:04.1
 So the O and the M is for mom. And Charlie; you can use A and D keys to make horizontal lines.,SPEAKER_00,04:04.8,04:12.0
 Hey; okay. And you guys are going to try to copy the picture of the house.,SPEAKER_00,04:13.3,00:04:17
 However; you're not allowed to touch each other's keys. Okay. So you really have to; you know;,SPEAKER_00,00:04:17,04:24.4
 collaborate on the picture. And you have eight minutes altogether. So I'm going to mute myself,SPEAKER_00,04:24.4,04:30.4
 and hide my video. So I'm not disturbing you during the task. And I'll set a timer. And I'll,SPEAKER_00,04:30.4,04:34.7
 just let you know when you're finished. And I think that's everything on my side. Is that clear,SPEAKER_00,04:34.7,04:42.8
 for both of you? Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Can we just; do we need to move the cursor into the,SPEAKER_00,04:42.8,04:49.2
 Etch's Catch middle? No; that's all right. Okay. All right. I wish you the best of luck. I'm,SPEAKER_00,04:49.2,00:04:57
 going to hide myself now. And I'll speak to you afterwards. Right. Right. So I've got to start for,SPEAKER_00,00:04:57,05:04.8
 the; okay; that's in the middle. Should we make the door? Matt as well since you're in the middle.,SPEAKER_01,05:04.8,05:11.5
 Right. So I've got a line. Can you go down please? Yeah. And I guess we could do the bottom now;,SPEAKER_01,05:11.5,05:18.8
 then come back and do. So if I go up; uh; nice; fine; I'll do the bottom of the house.,SPEAKER_01,05:18.8,00:05:23
 And then that's wait; wait; wait. Okay. Bring it back down. Bring it back down.,SPEAKER_01,00:05:23,05:31.9
 Right. Down. Okay. Okay. Now; now you can go up and do the side of the house.,SPEAKER_02,05:33.3,05:38.1
 And now we'll do the full square. Then we'll go back and finish the door.,SPEAKER_01,00:05:41,05:44.5
 Okay. So now we could go back and do the door. Go up. Please.,SPEAKER_01,05:44.9,05:55.7
 Right. And now go down again; please. Right. Now we could go do the roof.,SPEAKER_01,06:00.0,06:07.1
 All right. So then we really click it at the same time. Now go.,SPEAKER_01,06:07.1,06:15.2
 Oh; no; no; no; because you need. Okay. Okay. Let's go back down. And I'll tell you how to go.,SPEAKER_01,06:15.2,06:21.3
 Okay. Right. Three; two; one; go. Okay. Yeah. And now I guess we could just bring it back down.,SPEAKER_01,06:21.3,06:30.4
 Oh; especially pointy; isn't it? I think we made it too big. The new button should,SPEAKER_01,06:30.4,06:36.6
 let us reset it. And then we could start again. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Good. Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,06:36.6,06:41.3
 So it starts in the middle. So let's go horizontal and do the door. Oh; that's right at the top.,SPEAKER_01,06:41.3,06:46.8
 Okay. Let's go down. Okay. Down. Yeah. All the way down.,SPEAKER_01,06:46.8,06:51.8
 It's too far now. No; it's fine. We can start the button. Right. Should we start with the house?,SPEAKER_02,06:52.9,06:58.6
 I see. You'll see where it is. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Bring it up.,SPEAKER_01,06:58.6,07:01.6
 Okay. Now we could start like a smaller house. So we don't overshoot.,SPEAKER_01,07:02.3,07:08.6
 Oh; what's going on there? Up. Up. Okay. Cross. And down again.,SPEAKER_01,07:08.6,07:17.5
 Okay. Oh; you do the really small house. Well; yeah; because if it fits in;,SPEAKER_02,07:18.8,07:22.4
 and it works. Okay. Up. Yeah. Thank you. Down. Yeah. Right.,SPEAKER_01,07:23.1,07:30.3
 Right. Now. Three. Which way? Oh; man. Oh; okay. Go back. Go back down.,SPEAKER_01,07:34.8,07:43.7
 Now we click it. Go. Three. No. Can we go back? Okay. Try. Can we count on it?,SPEAKER_02,07:45.9,07:51.8
 Two. One. Go. Okay. Oh; it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. We could work with this.,SPEAKER_01,07:52.4,07:59.8
 I think. Right. Right now. Can we go? Now click. So go back down. Three. Can we count on it?,SPEAKER_01,07:59.8,08:04.5
 Three. Two. One. Go. Oh; okay. That kind of works. Okay. Let's do the chimney now.,SPEAKER_01,08:04.5,08:12.3
 So go back up. I just keep going up. Oh; no; because you need to go in the chimney needs to do a bit more.,SPEAKER_01,08:12.9,08:20.0
 Okay. Now go. Now go up. Okay. Cross. Oh; go back a bit.,SPEAKER_02,08:20.6,08:25.8
 Down. That's it. All right. Should we do not look like that?,SPEAKER_02,00:08:27,08:31.3
 House. Okay. Now; um; pick them. Three. Two. One.,SPEAKER_01,08:32.8,08:40.5
 Whoa. Okay. Now let's do the windows. Okay. Let's do a cross and a middle. Now go up and down.,SPEAKER_01,08:41.8,08:49.3
 Okay. Like that. And then down. And so first; click. Oh; and do it at the same time. Very short.,SPEAKER_01,08:50.0,08:58.7
 Okay. Three. Two. One. Go. Whoa. Okay. Click M. Let me; please.,SPEAKER_01,08:58.7,09:05.3
 Okay. Um; should we bring it back to the; yeah; bring it up a little bit.,SPEAKER_01,09:11.2,09:16.5
 Okay. So three. Two. Which one am I doing? Oh.,SPEAKER_01,09:17.2,09:21.4
 Yeah. Three. Two. One. Go. I didn't click it. That was my turn. Bring it back down.,SPEAKER_01,09:21.4,09:30.7
 Okay. All the way down. Just let's click. Um; this time.,SPEAKER_01,09:32.7,00:09:37
 Right. Okay. Three. Two. One. Go. Oh; I keep looking at the wrong time.,SPEAKER_01,00:09:37,09:42.5
 Okay. Yeah. Should we try the other side? Yeah. I don't think that's going to be any easier though.,SPEAKER_01,09:43.3,09:49.2
 Right. So let's bring it up. Okay.,SPEAKER_01,09:50.8,09:53.5
 Back down a little bit so I can do a cross. Okay. Right. So now; when I click. Oh;,SPEAKER_01,09:56.7,10:02.6
 I mean; when I click a; you're going to click. Oh; so we could build like the top. Right. Okay.,SPEAKER_01,10:03.2,10:09.1
 So three. Two. One. Go. Oh; we almost did it. That's close enough. Okay. Let's bring it down a bit.,SPEAKER_01,10:09.1,10:17.2
 And if we go; go in the opposite. Three. Two. One. Wait. Oh. Okay. And then go back and then,SPEAKER_01,10:17.2,10:23.6
 bring it down. And then go. Okay. Now I'm going to click D. You're going to click.,SPEAKER_01,10:23.6,10:30.2
 And three. Two. One. Go. Now the same thing. Yeah. Three. Two. One. Go.,SPEAKER_01,10:30.2,10:40.4
 Okay. Uh; bring it up.,SPEAKER_01,10:41.6,10:43.5
 Right. Have we done it? That looks terrible. Can we do it again? I mean; we can try how long do we have?,SPEAKER_02,10:49.2,10:56.4
 Don't know. But we drew the outline very quickly. So I think it's just a matter of. Let's try again.,SPEAKER_02,10:56.4,11:03.7
 Okay. Show me that time. Okay. Yeah. So this time; wait; let me; let me just draw a line to,SPEAKER_01,11:03.7,11:11.2
 like where we should be starting to see. Let me have those. Can you bring it down please?,SPEAKER_01,11:11.2,11:16.5
 Yeah. That's fine. Okay. Now we should stop. So I'll stop my line. Okay.,SPEAKER_01,11:16.5,11:24.7
 Now up. I'll do the outline. Yeah.,SPEAKER_02,11:25.9,11:28.9
 Now; done.,UNKNOWN,11:30.8,11:34.0
 Now let's do a big goal.,SPEAKER_01,11:37.6,00:11:39
 Up.,UNKNOWN,11:40.0,00:11:41
 Yes. Okay. Now go left. Up. I see you. Okay. Now. No. Three. Do. Wait; I'm going to say stop when we should stop.,SPEAKER_02,11:46.0,11:57.8
 And I'm around the middle. Oh; three. Two. One. Go. Okay. Now let's do the opposite. Three. Two. One.,SPEAKER_01,11:57.8,12:08.4
 Go. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Now. Chimney. We've got a perfect spot. The flat spot could be the chimney. Yeah. Go up.,SPEAKER_02,00:12:09,12:15.9
 And then across. Yeah. Oh; that's too big. Go back a bit.,SPEAKER_02,12:18.4,12:22.0
 Wrong way. That's me. That's fine. That's right. Okay. Let's go down. Just keep going straight down and we can do the door. So,SPEAKER_02,12:24.5,12:31.8
 we tend to do that. Oh; I mean; the window. I mean; same thing.,SPEAKER_02,12:32.8,12:37.5
 And then we're doing you're going to go down the window. Yeah. Okay. Now; oh; indeed;,SPEAKER_02,00:12:39,12:44.8
 are three; two; one. Go. Yeah. Oh; we did it. We did it. We did it. Okay. Okay.,SPEAKER_01,12:45.6,12:52.7
 Bring it down a little bit. So we go back onto the cross and not making any more extra lines. Okay. Ready. No; no. Okay.,SPEAKER_01,12:54.2,12:59.7
 Three. Two. One. Oh. Oh. Okay. We could work with this.,SPEAKER_01,13:00.1,13:07.2
 Let's make the other cross. Check them down. Yeah. All right. That's eight minutes there. Oh; no.,SPEAKER_01,13:10.0,13:15.4
 If you want to; you can keep going. It's up to you. You can try a little bit longer; but if you're ready to start; we can do that as well.,SPEAKER_01,13:16.8,13:22.7
 Okay. I think we've made enough of the mess of this. I think we have.,SPEAKER_01,13:23.5,13:29.2
 I think we've done all right. We've got the chimney just about. So pretty good.,SPEAKER_02,13:29.8,13:34.3
 And we've got the cost of the window. All right. You can just stop sharing your screen now.,SPEAKER_02,13:34.3,13:39.2
 And I will stop the recording.,SPEAKER_00,13:40.8,13:42.7
