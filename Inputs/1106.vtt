00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
Chloe Bilverstone: Go in now.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.530
Chloe Bilverstone: Perfect.

3
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:21.149
Chloe Bilverstone: It sounds like a robot, doesn't it? Right silly? I don't know how much Young has told you about like the study, but I've got a bit of information now to sort of talk you through, and then you can let me know if you want to proceed with the game. So I'm going to share my screen to just get

4
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.549
Chloe Bilverstone: up the information.

5
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:49.999
Chloe Bilverstone: Here it is. So can you see it there? Yeah. So I'll read through it as well, but I know some people prefer to like see it visually as well as here. So essentially, I go to a university in London. And I'm part of a team where we're looking into testing a new game that aims to help us understand parent and adolescent. So teenage relationships and communication. So the study involves playing an online game today with your mum for 8 min.

6
00:00:50.259 --> 00:01:01.659
Chloe Bilverstone: We're going to use Zoom to record the video as we're doing now. The game doesn't require any sort of like gaming skill. The rules are very simple, and I will explain them to you once we go ahead with the game.

7
00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:08.449
Chloe Bilverstone: In terms of your information. That will be kept like, I said, safe and secure. Only the research team will see it

8
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:24.739
Chloe Bilverstone: in terms of taking part. It's completely up to you. If you've got any questions you can let me know if you don't want to take part, you can also let me know, or if you sort of start, and then halfway through and change your mind, you can also stop then, too. So that's sort of the information. Do you have any questions?

9
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.660
Chloe Bilverstone: No. Are you happy to go ahead.

10
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:51.550
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, perfect. Thank you. So I'll just stop sharing my screen now. And I'm just now going to put the link to the game in the chat. 2 secs. I'll just paste that in. So if you could open that up and you should then get an option to either the keyboard or touch screen and obviously choose the one that's.

11
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.460
Liz Ferguson: Great to you.

12
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.200
Liz Ferguson: Yeah, we're in. We're on keyboard.

13
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.620
Chloe Bilverstone: And then, if you're able to share your screen again, please.

14
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.150
Liz Ferguson: can I hang on? You can tell? Oh, here we go.

15
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.010
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, perfect.

16
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.489
Chloe Bilverstone: Is that good

17
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:23.189
Chloe Bilverstone: to see it brilliant? Yeah. So you should see on the left hand side there's the picture of the house.

18
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.230
Liz Ferguson: Yes.

19
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.980
Chloe Bilverstone: Yes. So this is the etch, a sketch online. So have you, have you seen an etch, a sketch before?

20
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.400
Liz Ferguson: S.

21
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.969
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, yeah, so it's basically.

22
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.269
Liz Ferguson: Not really. I think we maybe had a really rubbish one.

23
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.569
Chloe Bilverstone: This was basically the Hubble. When I was younger.

24
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.675
Liz Ferguson: Like, 5 years ago. Yeah.

25
00:02:41.980 --> 00:03:04.100
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, so yeah, it's exactly the same as the physical one. But just online. And as I said, there's the picture on the side that we're going to want you to replicate onto the drawing pad. I guess you can call it so. There are some rules, though, to the game. So, Liz, you can only draw the lines that are vertical. So up and down by pressing the O. And M. Keys.

26
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:13.550
Chloe Bilverstone: and then, Leo, you can only make horizontal lines. So going side by side by pressing the A and d keys so you might need to swap. I'm not sure which side you, I think.

27
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.929
Liz Ferguson: We're actually on the right side.

28
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.339
Chloe Bilverstone: You're on the right side. Oh, perfect. Yeah, so and the most important thing, though, is that you're not allowed to touch each other's keys.

29
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.260
Liz Ferguson: Okay.

30
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:45.090
Chloe Bilverstone: So you've got to stick with your keys if you want to, at any point start again. There's a button at the top, right? You can see, I think, that says new. So once you start drawing, that will become clickable, so you can restart at any point if you need to. You'll have 8 min to copy the image together. I'm going to mute myself and like, hide my video. So I hopefully won't be distracted. But I'm here. If you need anything.

31
00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:56.680
Chloe Bilverstone: if you are finished before the time is up, then just start. You can start again, and we just essentially want you to be playing for the full 8 min. And then I will speak to you to tell you like when the time is up.

32
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.720
Liz Ferguson: Sure.

33
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.059
Chloe Bilverstone: So yeah, does that all sort of make sense.

34
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.160
Liz Ferguson: Yeah, and we're ready.

35
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.890
Chloe Bilverstone: Okay, I will get the ready to go. I'll get the timer up and I'll turn my audio and video off. And then you guys are good to go.

36
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.580
Liz Ferguson: Okay.

37
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.480
Chloe Bilverstone: Okay. Ready. Good.

38
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.869
Liz Ferguson: Do you want? I don't you go first.st

39
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.489
Liz Ferguson: Oh, look, okay. So we're in the middle.

40
00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.459
Liz Ferguson: So should we do the door? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.570
Liz Ferguson: Nice.

42
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.340
Liz Ferguson: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

43
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:42.069
Liz Ferguson: Wait. Do you want to go back up? It's too late. No, you can go back. Go back. Left. Press a wait.

44
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.770
Liz Ferguson: Yeah. Yeah. So do you think about there?

45
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.420
Liz Ferguson: Yeah, go up. Go up, go up, go up.

46
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.340
Liz Ferguson: hey? That's not bad. That's not bad. That's not too bad. Okay, do you want to go back? I'm going back down.

47
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.559
Liz Ferguson: Okay, we

48
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:17.769
Liz Ferguson: oh, are we joining on the line? How far. I think we need to go quite far, because we've got to do a circle, apparently in a minute. I don't know how that happens. Yeah. So yeah, give us plenty of room like that. Yeah, I reckon. Do you think? Go up? Okay?

49
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.980
Liz Ferguson: Oh, oh, so it's gonna be quite high. Yeah. But we've got a roof. Yeah, I'll go. I'll go. Yeah.

50
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.049
Liz Ferguson: I'm just going to do a big line.

51
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.680
Liz Ferguson: I'm gonna try and make it symmetrical, lovely. I love that. What do you think about like this? Yeah, that's good. Thank you. That's beautiful.

52
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.319
Liz Ferguson: Okay? Oh, oh, oh, do you think I went too far? Wait.

53
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.770
Liz Ferguson: I can't go up you go! Are you up? Go!

54
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:56.160
Liz Ferguson: Oh, that was thrilling. Okay, should we try and do the roof? Yeah. So we need. I'm going across, can you see?

55
00:05:57.088 --> 00:05:59.520
Liz Ferguson: There you go. Go.

56
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.249
Liz Ferguson: Okay, right? How do we do a diagonal?

57
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.580
Liz Ferguson: I think we need to do sort of both at once, a little bit.

58
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:15.259
Liz Ferguson: So if I hold down a and you hold down. O, what's gonna happen? Should we do a little bit? 3, 2, 1 go.

59
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:25.169
Liz Ferguson: No, it capped off because you sorry I stopped. I know I know. I know that was my fault. It's really good, though we could. We could just keep going.

60
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.760
Liz Ferguson: Oh, no, but we're not going to fit the whole thing in look.

61
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.459
Liz Ferguson: I think it's tied to like a nice route, but it's meant to be like that, though

62
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.519
Liz Ferguson: I think I think we could make it like a nice like.

63
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.799
Liz Ferguson: I mean, that's not the house, though.

64
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.479
Liz Ferguson: Then we go down. Okay, 1, 2, 3 go.

65
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.769
Liz Ferguson: Okay, wait, Leo, that's not the house. There we go. Oh, God!

66
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.720
Liz Ferguson: Oh, I can't go up. You gotta go up.

67
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.700
Liz Ferguson: I think we tried another line. Okay, now we have to do it again.

68
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:09.319
Liz Ferguson: No. Where are we even going? What we need to do? The I think we should start again. But start further down. Should we start again? Yeah, do you agree? Okay? Right?

69
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.560
Liz Ferguson: Okay.

70
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.760
Liz Ferguson: Right? That's okay. Where do we start again in the middle help?

71
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.190
Liz Ferguson: Why did we start there? Maybe because that's where we finished.

72
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.360
Liz Ferguson: So do we?

73
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:31.459
Liz Ferguson: Oh, yeah, yes, you're genius. Yeah. So let's start. You're a genius right? Go that way a bit more

74
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.689
Liz Ferguson: like that. Yeah, perfect. Are we ready? Yeah.

75
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.140
Liz Ferguson: wait.

76
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:50.159
Liz Ferguson: Yes, I was pressing the wrong button. Yes, yeah. Oh, this is this is so good. Right? So should I. I might just go across and then but no, don't go. Okay.

77
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.640
Liz Ferguson: Don't click anything.

78
00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:05.960
Liz Ferguson: Can I go up now? Wait. We need to do the door. No, we couldn't come back to the door. Let's try and get the if I think the roof is the painful bit, so we should make it, not as oh, no, but now we've made it really wide.

79
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:14.710
Liz Ferguson: It's fine. The house can be wide. Okay, it's a bungalow. Okay? A. And o 3, 2, 1!

80
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.409
Liz Ferguson: How big does it wait? Should we start at the roof?

81
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:23.919
Liz Ferguson: Oh.

82
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:30.930
Liz Ferguson: do you think we should start? Wait! Let's start at like a point. Let's start in the middle. Yeah, at the middle point.

83
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.870
Liz Ferguson: Hit.

84
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.750
Liz Ferguson: Oh, what the heck are you doing? Okay? Starting in the middle start there? Okay.

85
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:48.659
Liz Ferguson: imagine if it might already be 8 min, we might right. So are we doing? Which which side are we doing? You direct us? We'll do this way. Okay, so that's a, and m, 3, 2, 1,

86
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.130
Liz Ferguson: stop.

87
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:57.320
Liz Ferguson: Okay, what? Okay? Let's just make our house small. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So now, good. Go that way.

88
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.780
Liz Ferguson: Right?

89
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.010
Liz Ferguson: Stop.

90
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.482
Liz Ferguson: Okay. And then O and d

91
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.480
Liz Ferguson: a, I have to go left. Oh, yes, you're right. 3, 2, 1,

92
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:15.050
Liz Ferguson: please. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. So good. Wait, go down. Go down one.

93
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:26.059
Liz Ferguson: Yeah. Now we need to. Oh, my goodness, now we have to get back. Now we've got to get down. Okay? Right? Say, we're going this way. Yeah. A. And m. 2, 1.

94
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.060
Liz Ferguson: Oh, that's not bad, you know. That's not bad. And then go tiny bit that way.

95
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:39.570
Liz Ferguson: Oops. Wait. Oh, sorry now from here.

96
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.310
Liz Ferguson: Okay.

97
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.719
Liz Ferguson: Should we do the door?

98
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.129
Liz Ferguson: No, no, we're not doing the door. Go up

99
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.400
Liz Ferguson: not too too far too far too far. Oh.

100
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:08.500
Liz Ferguson: yes, we got it. Okay, should we do the chimney? Oh, God, okay, right. Up O, and a okay. Wait. Let's do like one click at a time. Yeah. And we're only going to do a little bit.

101
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.729
Liz Ferguson: One. Well, let's hold it down just for a second. Okay, 1, 2, 3 go.

102
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.490
Liz Ferguson: and then I'm gonna go go up. Yes, I'll go across.

103
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:30.859
Liz Ferguson: Hold on right. Okay, and then down M. And D, just for a little bit. 1, 2, 3 go.

104
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:44.920
Liz Ferguson: We're on the line. Okay? Should we do go down? Let's do the door. Wait. How do we do the circles? Yeah, I think we I don't. I mean, they're just etcher sketches. You have to have lines sometimes going across the picture.

105
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.779
Liz Ferguson: Do you make a really wide go

106
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.119
Liz Ferguson: from him. Make it look wide. You'd like, Okay.

107
00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:11.779
Liz Ferguson: go go. Such a sabotager. Right? Right? Okay. It's like a barn. Yeah, we didn't make a house. We own a barn. We need some smoke and then some coal. No, go to the corner.

108
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.429
Liz Ferguson: Where are we?

109
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.069
Liz Ferguson: Oh, I can't go up and down.

110
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.729
Liz Ferguson: Hey, guys, nice. Nice. Okay. Now.

111
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:29.329
Liz Ferguson: I have no idea how we're meant to do this, I think.

112
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.429
Liz Ferguson: how do you think we do this? Oh, yeah, yeah. So

113
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.759
Liz Ferguson: what are you thinking I can't go up? You go up. Why do I need to go up?

114
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.910
Liz Ferguson: Yeah, okay, just do it.

115
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:54.840
Liz Ferguson: From here. So I'm gonna go D, and you're gonna go. But we need to not just hold it down because it'll just make a straight line. I think I think we might need to. Yeah, do a bit of tappy tap. Okay, go on.

116
00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.590
Liz Ferguson: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's working. It's working. Stop.

117
00:12:02.628 --> 00:12:09.730
Liz Ferguson: Wait. And now and now we go the other way. Okay, go. Go which way. Wait. Wait. Do you mean down?

118
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.810
Liz Ferguson: Yeah, okay, good.

119
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.580
Liz Ferguson: I'm clicking the wrong button.

120
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.880
Chloe Bilverstone: Okay, that is your time. Up.

121
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.690
Liz Ferguson: 8 min.

122
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.450
Chloe Bilverstone: Done. So I'm gonna stop the recording now.
