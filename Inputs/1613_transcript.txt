[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:00 --> 0:00:08]  Yeah, you should have had a very book voice tell you that it's started recording.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:08 --> 0:00:09]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:09 --> 0:00:15]  So Emilia, I don't know how much of that has told you about the study, but I'm going to give you some information about it now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:15 --> 0:00:19]  And then you can let me know if you're okay with going ahead with it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:19 --> 0:00:20]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:20 --> 0:00:23]  That's not good. Yes. I'll just share my screen.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:23 --> 0:00:25]  Give me two seconds.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:25 --> 0:00:29]  Okay. So you should be able to see my screen now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:29 --> 0:00:33]  Yeah, so I'm just going to read sort of read this out to you, but you can read it as well, if you like.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:33 --> 0:00:44]  So essentially, as you probably know, I go to a university in London and I'm in a team looking at testing a new game that is we're hoping will help us understand parent and adolescent.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:44 --> 0:00:53]  So children between the ages of 11 and 15, their relationships and communication.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:53 --> 0:00:59]  The study will involve you playing an all my game with your dad today for eight minutes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:59 --> 0:01:04]  We're going to use zoom to record a video of you playing the game doesn't require any gaming skill.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:04 --> 0:01:08]  The rules are very simple and I'll explain to you before we start.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:08 --> 0:01:17]  In terms of the information you give us, like I said, the video will just be kept safe and secure and no one outside of the research team will see your video.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:17 --> 0:01:21]  You don't have to take part. It's completely up to you. You can let me know if you've got any questions.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:21 --> 0:01:25]  And yeah, if you do want to take part, we can get going.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:01:25 --> 0:01:28]  Yeah, yeah, happy with it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:28 --> 0:01:35]  So I will stop sharing my screen now and I'm going to just put in the chat a link to the game.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:35 --> 0:01:38]  Two seconds.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:01:38 --> 0:01:41]  You want to do it there?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:41 --> 0:01:44]  Yeah, right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:44 --> 0:01:47]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:47 --> 0:01:52]  It is normally the kids doing it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:52 --> 0:02:00]  Yeah, and so you click keyboard or touch screen dependent on what device you're on.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:00 --> 0:02:04]  Yeah, is that all opened up?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:04 --> 0:02:10]  Yeah, and then you set on the left.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:02:10 --> 0:02:13]  You're looking at the screen around the right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:13 --> 0:02:16]  So I think it'll be easier if she's sad.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:16 --> 0:02:21]  So it's best if she sat on the right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:21 --> 0:02:28]  I can never tell with the zoom it sort of reverses it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:28 --> 0:02:32]  So we'll just be easier with the keys that you're going to be using.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:02:32 --> 0:02:36]  Yeah, so I'm looking at the screen on the right hand side now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:36 --> 0:02:39]  So if I just talk you through sort of the rules.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:39 --> 0:02:41]  So this is the edge of sketch.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:41 --> 0:02:43]  Have you guys seen edge of sketch before?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:02:43 --> 0:02:44]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:44 --> 0:02:47]  Yeah, so it's basically the same, but online.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:47 --> 0:02:50]  And you should be able to see a picture on the left.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:50 --> 0:02:51]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:51 --> 0:02:56]  Yeah, so we're going to like you to copy that picture onto the edge of sketch by working together.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:56 --> 0:02:58]  But there are some rules.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:58 --> 0:03:00]  Not hard.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:00 --> 0:03:03]  Adam, you can only draw lines that are vertical.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:03 --> 0:03:06]  You can just pop and down by pressing the O and M keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:06 --> 0:03:07]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:07 --> 0:03:10]  And then Amelia, you can only make horizontal lines.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:10 --> 0:03:13]  So go inside by side by pressing the A and D keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:13 --> 0:03:17]  And the important thing to remember is you're not allowed to touch each other's keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:03:17 --> 0:03:18]  Oh.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:03:18 --> 0:03:19]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:19 --> 0:03:23]  So Adam, O and M keys and Amelia, A and D keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:23 --> 0:03:24]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:24 --> 0:03:29]  If you want to at any point, you can clear it and start over so there should be a.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:30 --> 0:03:32]  That would be quite cool, actually.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:32 --> 0:03:33]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:33 --> 0:03:35]  But no, it's a bit more boring option.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:35 --> 0:03:37]  So there's a bit of button at the top right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:37 --> 0:03:38]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:38 --> 0:03:39]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:39 --> 0:03:40]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:40 --> 0:03:41]  That'll become clickable.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:41 --> 0:03:42]  You'll play for eight minutes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:42 --> 0:03:44]  And I will meet myself, hide my videos.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:44 --> 0:03:46]  So I won't hopefully distract you.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:46 --> 0:03:47]  But I am here if you need anything.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:47 --> 0:03:48]  If you got any.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:48 --> 0:03:50]  If you are finished before the time is up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:50 --> 0:03:52]  If you can just sort of keep playing.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:52 --> 0:03:53]  So just restart it again.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:53 --> 0:03:56]  We just essentially want you to be playing for the full eight minutes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:56 --> 0:03:57]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:57 --> 0:03:59]  I will speak to you to tell you when the time is up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:59 --> 0:04:01]  And then that's the only part we use for our research.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:01 --> 0:04:03]  I'll stop recording at that point.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:03 --> 0:04:04]  I always.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:04 --> 0:04:05]  Is everything clear?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:05 --> 0:04:06]  Do you have any questions?

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:04:06 --> 0:04:07]  No, it should be right to me.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:07 --> 0:04:08]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:08 --> 0:04:11]  Are you able to share your screen?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:11 --> 0:04:12]  Just.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:12 --> 0:04:15]  I'm a name, Amy.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:15 --> 0:04:16]  Where is it?

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:04:16 --> 0:04:17]  You got to be on here.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:04:17 --> 0:04:20]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:20 --> 0:04:25]  So the bottom should be on zoom.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:25 --> 0:04:32]  You go back on zoom.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:32 --> 0:04:33]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:33 --> 0:04:34]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:34 --> 0:04:37]  And then at the bottom there should be the shadow.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:04:37 --> 0:04:40]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:40 --> 0:04:41]  We got it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:41 --> 0:04:43]  Got it.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:04:43 --> 0:04:45]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:04:45 --> 0:04:46]  We're on.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:04:46 --> 0:04:47]  Yep.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:47 --> 0:04:50]  And then you get to go back on the game.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:04:50 --> 0:04:51]  Well, that.

[Speaker SPEAKER_03] [0:04:51 --> 0:04:53]  So maybe take over.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:53 --> 0:04:54]  I can't see.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:54 --> 0:04:56]  I can't see you.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:56 --> 0:04:58]  You can exit there with it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:58 --> 0:05:00]  Yeah, perfect.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:00 --> 0:05:01]  Right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:01 --> 0:05:05]  So I'm going to get the time up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:05 --> 0:05:07]  You guys are ready to go.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:07 --> 0:05:08]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:08 --> 0:05:09]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:09 --> 0:05:10]  Perfect.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:05:10 --> 0:05:11]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:11 --> 0:05:13]  I'll start the timer now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:13 --> 0:05:14]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:14 --> 0:05:15]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:15 --> 0:05:17]  And then I go right there.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:05:17 --> 0:05:19]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:05:19 --> 0:05:20]  I can't.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:20 --> 0:05:22]  I can't go down.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:05:22 --> 0:05:23]  Down.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:05:23 --> 0:05:24]  Down.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:47 --> 0:05:53]  They hold, I think you have to press them at the same time, so if you press up,

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:05:53 --> 0:05:55]  They're down a bit first, right?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:55 --> 0:05:56]  No, you have to go up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:56 --> 0:05:57]  Ready?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:55 --> 0:09:57]  It's awful.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:09:57 --> 0:09:59]  I have to sit there across.
