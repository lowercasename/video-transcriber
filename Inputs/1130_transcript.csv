text,speaker,start,end
 should have had a robot say. So; Finnie; I don't know if you're almost told you much about,SPEAKER_00,0:00:00,0:00:10.280000
 the study already. No; that's fine. She's just volunteered you about 10 years.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:10.280000,0:00:18
 I thought you'd be right through it; yeah. So I will get it up on the screen. I don't know,SPEAKER_00,0:00:18,0:00:23.560000
 about you; but I find it easier to read something sometimes; but I will read out as well.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:23.560000,0:00:27.680000
 So I'll just share my screen. Yeah; should be able to see my screen now. I'll just get this one up.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:27.680000,0:00:37.680000
 Oh; there we go. Fab. Yeah; well; I'm just going to read through it a little bit. So essentially;,SPEAKER_00,0:00:37.680000,0:00:43.120000
 I go to university in London and I'm part of like a team of researchers that we're looking,SPEAKER_00,0:00:43.120000,0:00:47.520000
 into testing this new game that's hoping we hope will help us understand a little bit more,SPEAKER_00,0:00:47.520000,0:00:52.240000
 about pairing and adolescence; like teenagers; relationships and communication. So essentially;,SPEAKER_00,0:00:52.240000,0:00:58.560000
 all you have to do today is play an online game with your mum for eight minutes. We're going to,SPEAKER_00,0:00:58.560000,0:01:03.440000
 use Zoom to record a video of you playing. The game doesn't require any gaming skill. The rules,SPEAKER_00,0:01:03.440000,0:01:09.440000
 are very simple and I'll explain them to you in a second. It's designed to be fun. So hopefully;,SPEAKER_00,0:01:09.440000,0:01:14.800000
 yeah; it will be good. In terms of the information you give us today; so the video; like I said;,SPEAKER_00,0:01:14.800000,0:01:19.920000
 it'll be kept safe and secure. No one outside of the research team will see it and we'd only tell,SPEAKER_00,0:01:19.920000,0:01:24.880000
 someone if we were worried about your safety; which I'm sure we're not going to be. So taking part;,SPEAKER_00,0:01:24.880000,0:01:30.960000
 it's completely up to you. If you've got any questions; you can ask me before we start.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:31.760000,0:01:35.920000
 If you do decide you'd like to take part; we can start now. If you don't; or maybe you decide sort,SPEAKER_00,0:01:36.960000,0:01:41.600000
 of halfway through the game; don't run anymore. You can stop at any time. Yeah; you're all up for it.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:41.600000,0:01:48.400000
 Yeah; yeah; perfect. So I'll stop sharing my screen now. And I'm now going to paste,SPEAKER_00,0:01:48.400000,0:01:53.760000
 into the chat the link of the game. Let's put that in the chat now. So if you're able to just,SPEAKER_00,0:01:54.480000,0:02:04.560000
 open that up. Yeah. And you should get an option that will say either choose between keyboard,SPEAKER_00,0:02:04.560000,0:02:13.120000
 and touch screen. Obviously; just choose which one applies to you. Oh; okay. What when you click on,SPEAKER_00,0:02:13.120000,0:02:17.520000
 the link; yeah; you click on the link; yeah; it should then give you the option to do keyboard or,SPEAKER_00,0:02:17.520000,0:02:21.600000
 touch screen. Okay; keyboard is on the laptop. There we go. Yep. Fab; brilliant. And then if you're,SPEAKER_00,0:02:21.600000,0:02:27.600000
 able to share your screen with me. I need to open up my card. I need to at least put this on,SPEAKER_01,0:02:27.600000,0:02:41.680000
 there. If you're going back on; so you're on zoom. Got it. Yeah; here we go. And then if you share the screen.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:47.680000,0:02:59.600000
 There we go. Fab; yep. That's good. You can see that. Brilliant. And then; um;,SPEAKER_01,0:03:03.600000,0:03:09.200000
 filling; are you sat on the left? Yeah; do we need to stop places?,SPEAKER_00,0:03:09.200000,0:03:13.840000
 So yeah; so I think it's easier for these on the left; because with the keys that you're,SPEAKER_00,0:03:14.640000,0:03:18.320000
 going to use; I can't tell with the mirroring of zoom. That's okay.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:18.320000,0:03:21.600000
 You make sure this has got plenty. Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:03:24.640000,0:03:26
 All right. Can you reach it? All right. Yeah. Yeah. Fab; so brilliant. So this is extra,SPEAKER_00,0:03:29.920000,0:03:37.840000
 sketch. Have you ever seen the extra sketch toy before? Yeah. Yeah. You have won many years ago.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:37.840000,0:03:44.560000
 Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. So it's basically the same as the toy online. And essentially;,SPEAKER_01,0:03:44.560000,0:03:51.920000
 can you see the picture on the left? Yeah. What we're going to want you to copy onto the,SPEAKER_00,0:03:51.920000,0:03:57.120000
 extra sketch by working together. But there are a few rules to the game. So Gemma; you can only draw,SPEAKER_00,0:03:57.120000,0:04:02.400000
 lines that are vertical. So up and down and by pressing the O and M keys. And then finally;,SPEAKER_00,0:04:02.400000,0:04:07.760000
 you can only make horizontal lines. So go inside by side by pressing A and D keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:07.760000,0:04:12.720000
 But this; and this is important; you can't touch each other's keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:13.920000,0:04:16.800000
 Remember; you can only touch your keys. If you want to any point; you can; if you see in the top,SPEAKER_00,0:04:18.880000,0:04:23.520000
 right corner; there's a new button. So once you start drawing; that will become like clickable.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:23.520000,0:04:27.360000
 So if you do want to sort of start again; you can press new and it will refresh you.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:27.360000,0:04:33.280000
 You'll have eight minutes to copy the image together. I'll meet myself and hide my video to,SPEAKER_00,0:04:34.560000,0:04:38.640000
 sort of avoid any distractions. But I am here if you need anything or have any issues.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:38.640000,0:04:42.560000
 I'll speak to you to tell you when the time is up. And then that's the only part we use for,SPEAKER_00,0:04:43.200000,0:04:46.800000
 the research. And I'll stop recording at that point. Yeah. Is everything sort of clear; Javani? Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:46.800000,0:04:52.320000
 Yeah. Yeah. No question.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:52.320000,0:04:54.800000
 Very good. Very good. So I think if you move your camera a little bit; Jami;,SPEAKER_00,0:04:56,0:05:00.480000
 you're not quite fully in the screen. They are perfect. Yeah; I think I've told you everything;,SPEAKER_00,0:05:00.480000,0:05:05.840000
 I need to get worried that I'm going to forget something. I think; oh; that was it. Just again;,SPEAKER_00,0:05:05.840000,0:05:11.920000
 we kind of want you to play for the full eight minutes. So if you do also finish the image;,SPEAKER_00,0:05:11.920000,0:05:15.440000
 you can just start again and do it again. So I'm just going to get my time up.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:15.440000,0:05:21.360000
 Yeah. And then whenever you're ready to go; we can start. Ready? Yeah. Okay.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:23.040000,0:05:27.760000
 And then you start there.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:27.760000,0:05:29.600000
 Which part are you doing at the minute? So you're doing the; yeah; okay; that's fine.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:39.840000,0:05:45.280000
 Yep. Okay. Yeah. Right. So then you want me to come down.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:45.280000,0:05:52.240000
 Oh; no; that's the wrong way. End this down. Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:54.400000,0:05:59.200000
 Then you're going to have to get back. That's it. It's going to be a very funny change,SPEAKER_01,0:06:03.760000,0:06:08.800000
 house; isn't it? Yeah. That's that right. Oh; yeah; we're done. Literally.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:08.800000,0:06:15.680000
 Now; we can now do we do the same time. So which one; which one; which one; which,SPEAKER_01,0:06:17.680000,0:06:24.320000
 were we here? Are we going to play? Yeah; I was up. So ready? One; two; three.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:24.320000,0:06:29.200000
 Look at that. Okay. We'll make it a flat roof; maybe. I'm ready. A bit further.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:31.040000,0:06:35.840000
 And then I'll bookish and have a look. That's really funny. Shake; group. Do you want to try again?,SPEAKER_01,0:06:36.640000,0:06:46.720000
 Do you want to try again? No. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. So where do we want to go now?,SPEAKER_01,0:06:50.480000,0:06:55.840000
 Oh; like make the like ball. So where is the little thing? Where's the line at the moment?,SPEAKER_01,0:06:56.400000,0:07:03.120000
 We need to come back down. Don't raise the bottom line. Then you need to go across.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:03.520000,0:07:08.720000
 Now just leave it. I'll switch it. No; no; no; no; don't because there's stuff in there that,SPEAKER_01,0:07:13.440000,0:07:19.040000
 can't be washed there. And please leave it alone. So how do we do the window? I don't know;,SPEAKER_01,0:07:19.040000,0:07:26.480000
 maybe like a line. What you want to go across and then draw a window. That's going to be,SPEAKER_02,0:07:26.480000,0:07:32.640000
 really funny; isn't it? They can be square windows. You want to be square windows? I think you've,SPEAKER_01,0:07:32.640000,0:07:36.560000
 got to try and make them round. Where's your line going? I can't see it. Oh; there it is. Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:36.560000,0:07:44.800000
 One; two; five. You need to come back. Back. Go back. I'm just going back into here; don't,SPEAKER_01,0:07:44.800000,0:07:51.680000
 worry. I know you can't. I'm not touching the bottom. No; you can't like go back on it.,SPEAKER_02,0:07:52.240000,0:07:59.200000
 You need it needs to lie. Yeah; you can. Look; I'm almost doing it. Okay; so if we do that;,SPEAKER_02,0:08:00,0:08:05.440000
 what then across? Then you go across. Yeah. That. Whoa. And then if I go;,SPEAKER_01,0:08:05.440000,0:08:12.480000
 you go across again. And then if I go down; you go across again. Whoa. You need to back up.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:12.480000,0:08:25.120000
 You need to reverse it. You need to reverse it. Yeah; no; I see. Yeah; no; that does work;,SPEAKER_01,0:08:25.120000,0:08:31.840000
 doesn't it? I don't want to go too far now. Yeah; down. That's it. Yeah; down.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:31.840000,0:08:41.040000
 Can't go down. Oh; no; I'm down. I'm like; yeah. And then you across. You want you to come back,SPEAKER_01,0:08:41.040000,0:08:46.400000
 to this bit? No; no; no; we need to go up. And then we need to do the paint across that side;,SPEAKER_01,0:08:46.400000,0:08:54.640000
 don't you? Yeah; but you need to. Oh; I need to out. Yeah; okay. There you go.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:54.880000,0:09:00.800000
 There's a year across. Oh; stop. And then go up to light there and then light across.,SPEAKER_02,0:09:00.800000,0:09:10.560000
 Oh; I'm going down one. There you go.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:12.080000,0:09:14.320000
 Okay.,UNKNOWN,0:09:14.320000,0:09:16
 Oh; oh; oh; and then I'm going down. Whoa.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:16,0:09:24
 I need to back up. That's nothing; don't you? Yeah; that you'll go on that down.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:38.720000,0:09:42.240000
 I have done. It's here. We're here. Look.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:42.960000,0:09:45.200000
 Now do it. Oh; that looks like traffic on. Okay; up and then down. Yeah. Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:48.400000,0:10:00.720000
 Okay; we need to try and put a little bit of chimney in here to make it look. Yeah. Okay;,SPEAKER_01,0:10:01.920000,0:10:06.880000
 so far you need to get the chimney in the picture. Yeah; I know.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:06.880000,0:10:10.320000
 So go across a bit more. Stop.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:11.440000,0:10:14.480000
 Whoa.,UNKNOWN,0:10:16.960000,0:10:17.360000
 Why?,UNKNOWN,0:10:20.080000,0:10:20.720000
 I think you should keep it ever.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:22.080000,0:10:24.320000
 You can go a bit higher and then you go across.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:26.080000,0:10:27.920000
 Oh; I think you can make it in one cake. Oh; we're going to look at that house. Yeah.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:29.600000,0:10:36.400000
 You want to try and do it for a while?,SPEAKER_01,0:10:37.680000,0:10:39.440000
 Marry. We need to get a little bit of a minute.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:40.160000,0:10:43.280000
 There needs to be a door hinge.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:43.280000,0:10:44.640000
 Oh; they're going to open the door.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:44.640000,0:10:45.920000
 There's no door hinge in that pit.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:45.920000,0:10:46.800000
 How are they going to open the door?,SPEAKER_02,0:10:46.800000,0:10:48
 I'm going to do it.,UNKNOWN,0:10:49.040000,0:10:50.160000
 Oh; we're going to be trying to straighten it out a bit.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:54.720000,0:10:59.600000
 Okay.,UNKNOWN,0:11:01.040000,0:11:01.360000
 So where are you going?,SPEAKER_01,0:11:06.880000,0:11:10.560000
 Which would need to go down on.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:10.560000,0:11:12.560000
 No; you're not here.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:12.560000,0:11:13.920000
 No; oh; it's what's this going to be?,SPEAKER_01,0:11:13.920000,0:11:18.240000
 Door hinge.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:18.240000,0:11:19.600000
 It's a really big door hinge.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:19.600000,0:11:21.600000
 In the door.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:21.600000,0:11:24.560000
 Okay.,UNKNOWN,0:11:24.560000,0:11:26.320000
 So; smile; that is interesting.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:26.320000,0:11:30.480000
 It's almost like I got half the garage there; isn't it?,SPEAKER_01,0:11:30.480000,0:11:32.480000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:32.480000,0:11:33.280000
 So; if you use your arrays and go around the door;,SPEAKER_01,0:11:33.280000,0:11:40.480000
 we can make a little; like; um;,SPEAKER_01,0:11:40.480000,0:11:41.840000
 frame.,UNKNOWN,0:11:42.880000,0:11:43.200000
 That's all hinge.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:47.440000,0:11:48.640000
 So; that looks like a handle.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:48.640000,0:11:50.880000
 Reverse it up.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:50.880000,0:11:51.760000
 It can be a handle.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:51.760000,0:11:53.040000
 Reverse it up.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:53.040000,0:11:53.920000
 Reverse it up.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:53.920000,0:11:54.560000
 Reverse it up.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:54.560000,0:11:55.840000
 Stop.,UNKNOWN,0:11:55.840000,0:11:56.160000
 Oh; long.,UNKNOWN,0:11:56.720000,0:11:58.720000
 I've got a little door hinge on that.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:04.720000,0:12:08.960000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:08.960000,0:12:09.520000
 Um;,SPEAKER_01,0:12:09.520000,0:12:10.720000
 where should it look?,SPEAKER_01,0:12:10.720000,0:12:14.960000
 Oh; there we go.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:14.960000,0:12:15.760000
 Stop; stop; stop; then.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:15.760000,0:12:16.640000
 And I'll go up.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:16.640000,0:12:17.200000
 I'm just going to put a little garage on the side.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:17.200000,0:12:19.680000
 Oh.,UNKNOWN,0:12:20.160000,0:12:21.200000
 Nice.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:23.200000,0:12:24.560000
 And then if we reverse it;,SPEAKER_01,0:12:24.560000,0:12:26.720000
 if you go back and I'll go down there;,SPEAKER_01,0:12:26.720000,0:12:28.640000
 we can put it going.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:28.640000,0:12:29.600000
 I shouldn't have that wrong.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:32,0:12:32.800000
 Complete; um; like; at the corner.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:32.800000,0:12:34.480000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:34.480000,0:12:34.800000
 Why don't go there?,SPEAKER_01,0:12:35.760000,0:12:36.560000
 Then you go across.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:39.600000,0:12:40.480000
 We have these.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:42.400000,0:12:43.440000
 All right.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:43.440000,0:12:43.680000
 Stop; stop; stop; you know.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:43.680000,0:12:44.640000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:44.640000,0:12:46.240000
 Yep.,UNKNOWN,0:12:52.240000,0:12:52.960000
 Back off.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:52.960000,0:12:54
 Reverse it.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:54,0:12:55.040000
 You should reverse it.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:57.280000,0:12:58.480000
 I can't.,SPEAKER_01,0:12:58.480000,0:12:59.440000
 Why?,SPEAKER_01,0:12:59.440000,0:12:59.920000
 Oh; yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:13:00.960000,0:13:01.920000
