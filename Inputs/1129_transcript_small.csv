text,speaker,start,end
 So I'm just; I should have had a robot tell you that we're now recording.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:00,0:00:04.080000
 So you and I don't know how much your mum's told you about the study but I'm going to just talk,SPEAKER_00,0:00:05.280000,0:00:08.880000
 you through it now and like what will happen and then you can let me know if you want to,SPEAKER_00,0:00:08.880000,0:00:12.880000
 proceed with it. So I'll just start sharing my screen; give me two secs,SPEAKER_00,0:00:12.880000,0:00:19.280000
 and bring that up. So can you see a document there?,SPEAKER_00,0:00:21.600000,0:00:24.160000
 Yeah; yeah so I'm going to read it out but just in case you prefer to read yourself.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:25.040000,0:00:29.520000
 But essentially I go to a university in London and I'm part of a team that are,SPEAKER_00,0:00:29.600000,0:00:33.600000
 trying out this new game to help us understand parent and adolescent relationships and,SPEAKER_00,0:00:33.600000,0:00:38.320000
 communication. So in terms of what the study involves; essentially you'll play an online,SPEAKER_00,0:00:38.320000,0:00:43.440000
 game today with your mum for eight minutes. We're going to be using Zoom to record a video,SPEAKER_00,0:00:43.440000,0:00:48.160000
 of you playing. It doesn't require any game skill. The rules are very simple and I'll explain,SPEAKER_00,0:00:48.160000,0:00:52.720000
 to you both before we get started. In terms of the information you give us; so the video;,SPEAKER_00,0:00:53.360000,0:00:58.720000
 like I said; it will be kept safe and secure and no one outside of the research team will see the,SPEAKER_00,0:00:58.720000,0:01:03.440000
 video. You don't have the take part; it is completely up to you and you can let me know if,SPEAKER_00,0:01:03.440000,0:01:07.280000
 you have any questions. If you do decide to take part; we can get going with the game now.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:07.280000,0:01:11.840000
 If not; you can let me know and if you decide halfway free you want to stop as well; you can,SPEAKER_00,0:01:11.840000,0:01:16.720000
 also do that. Are you happy to proceed? Yeah. Yep; perfect. So I'll stop sharing my screen and,SPEAKER_00,0:01:16.720000,0:01:23.600000
 I'm now just going to put in the chat; the link to the game. So pop that in there now. So if you,SPEAKER_00,0:01:23.600000,0:01:34.960000
 can just open the link up and it should give you the option to either click keyboard or touchscreen,SPEAKER_00,0:01:34.960000,0:01:40.240000
 and you can obviously click which one is applicable to you.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:41.200000,0:01:43.520000
 Does that come up okay? Yeah. Yeah; and then are you able to share your screen with me again please?,SPEAKER_00,0:01:44,0:01:56.720000
 Yeah. Thank you.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:58.160000,0:01:59.840000
 Oh; no; no; no.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:59.840000,0:02:07.200000
 So you have to go back on to Zoom and then it should be at the bottom again.,SPEAKER_03,0:02:07.200000,0:02:11.200000
 Disappeared.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:12.560000,0:02:13.680000
 Zoom has disappeared or? You're there; but the... So if you go; like on the bottom of your screen;,SPEAKER_00,0:02:15.680000,0:02:27.680000
 or you're doing it through your browser.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:28.560000,0:02:31.920000
 There we go; got it. Got it. Yeah; and then if you can just share your screen; that'll be fab.,SPEAKER_03,0:02:34.720000,0:02:45.040000
 Perfect. I think that's just coming through now. So yeah; brilliant. So you should be,SPEAKER_00,0:02:48.560000,0:02:54.480000
 able to see an etcher sketch on the screen. Have you guys seen an etcher sketch before?,SPEAKER_00,0:02:54.480000,0:02:59.280000
 Yeah. Yeah; so it's basically the same as the physical one; but online and essentially,SPEAKER_00,0:03:00.560000,0:03:06.480000
 we would like you to copy the picture you should see on the left; so the house onto,SPEAKER_00,0:03:07.440000,0:03:13.680000
 etcher sketch by working together; but there are some rules to it. So Liz; you can only draw,SPEAKER_00,0:03:13.680000,0:03:19.840000
 lines a vertical; so up and down by pressing the O and the M keys; and then you and you can only make,SPEAKER_00,0:03:19.840000,0:03:26.560000
 horizontal lines; so going side by side by pressing the A and D keys. So I don't know if you're like,SPEAKER_00,0:03:26.560000,0:03:33.120000
 the right way round; I think. No; we're not. We want to stop round. There we go. And essentially,SPEAKER_00,0:03:33.120000,0:03:43.920000
 the most important thing to remember is you can't touch each other's keys. So,SPEAKER_00,0:03:43.920000,0:03:48.720000
 yeah; like I said; Liz; O and M keys; and you and A and D keys. If you want to at any point;,SPEAKER_00,0:03:50,0:03:55.600000
 you can restart it. So there is a; at the top right; there is a button; a new button;,SPEAKER_00,0:03:55.600000,0:04:01.760000
 you should be able to see. And once you start drawing; that will become clickable.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:01.760000,0:04:05.200000
 And you can restart at any point. You're going to be playing for eight minutes.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:06.160000,0:04:09.840000
 If you do finish beforehand; if you can just restart and play again; essentially we just,SPEAKER_00,0:04:11.040000,0:04:15.360000
 want you to be playing for the full eight minutes; if that's okay. I will turn my,SPEAKER_00,0:04:15.440000,0:04:20.400000
 camera off and my microphone off; so hopefully I won't distract. But if you have got any issues;,SPEAKER_00,0:04:20.400000,0:04:24.400000
 just obviously saying I can come back on. I'm going to get a timer up. And yeah; that's it.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:24.400000,0:04:30.560000
 Do you sort of have any questions or does it all make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay; I'll just get my timer,SPEAKER_00,0:04:30.560000,0:04:37.040000
 ready. So yeah; like I said; I'll turn my camera off and then I'll come back on after the eight,SPEAKER_00,0:04:37.040000,0:04:42.160000
 minutes. So I'll press start now.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:42.160000,0:04:45.040000
 That's the reason I have to do it.,SPEAKER_03,0:04:50.400000,0:04:52.080000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_02,0:04:52.080000,0:05:02.080000
 Oh; is it not; is it not working?,SPEAKER_00,0:05:12.800000,0:05:14.400000
 Oh; I think; I think I've lost you guys.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:14.400000,0:05:24.400000
 Can you guys hear me? I can't hear you. Can you hear me?,SPEAKER_00,0:05:34.560000,0:05:38.080000
 Yeah. Oh; you're sort of cutting out a little bit.,SPEAKER_03,0:05:39.040000,0:05:42.960000
 Oh; I think you're back now. I think it was sort of; it was cutting out. Is it; is it not working;,SPEAKER_00,0:05:49.920000,0:05:54.160000
 the game? It just says internet connection is unstable. Oh; you're back; you're back now. I,SPEAKER_00,0:05:54.160000,0:06:00.640000
 can hear you now. So is the game; is the game not working? No. Yeah; I'm pressing O and M.,SPEAKER_00,0:06:00.640000,0:06:08
 Have you tried like sort of click using the mustn't click on like the middle of the screen?,SPEAKER_00,0:06:08,0:06:12.800000
 And then try. No; it just makes a noise. Oh; is it drawing? I think it's drawing now. I can see a line.,SPEAKER_00,0:06:15.040000,0:06:25.520000
 We can't see anything. Oh; the dial things move; but we can't see any lines at all.,SPEAKER_00,0:06:25.520000,0:06:35.280000
 That is weird. Maybe if we; if you go off the page and then re click the link.,SPEAKER_03,0:06:35.280000,0:06:42.160000
 I'm sorry about that. I don't; that's not happened before. So I'm not sure why it's done that.,SPEAKER_00,0:06:43.440000,0:06:47.440000
 Yeah. Maybe if you like refresh it and see if that works.,SPEAKER_00,0:06:48.480000,0:06:51.200000
 He is right.,SPEAKER_03,0:06:55.600000,0:06:56.080000
 Yeah. Rosie; come off a bit and then.,SPEAKER_03,0:07:04.400000,0:07:07.200000
 Oh.,UNKNOWN,0:07:08.320000,0:07:08.720000
 That was in the way maybe.,SPEAKER_03,0:07:16.640000,0:07:17.840000
 Yeah.,UNKNOWN,0:07:25.760000,0:07:26.400000
 Again.,SPEAKER_00,0:07:34.480000,0:07:34.880000
 My game.,SPEAKER_03,0:07:51.440000,0:07:51.920000
 hopefully it will work at this time not yeah I'm not sure why oh yeah it's working,SPEAKER_03,0:07:51.920000,0:07:59.920000
 now yeah it's working yeah okay well if you can reshare your screen with me again,SPEAKER_03,0:07:59.920000,0:08:03.880000
 and then we can yeah restart it yeah I don't know why that was must must have,SPEAKER_00,0:08:03.880000,0:08:09.160000
 just been yeah messing up okay I will reset the timer so if I just get the,SPEAKER_00,0:08:09.160000,0:08:23.480000
