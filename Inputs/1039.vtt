1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.150
Chloe Bilverstone: So she

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.349
Chloe Bilverstone: should have had a robot. Tell you that the recording is in progress. Perfect. So is it, Cosmo? I believe.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.130
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah.

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:23.099
Chloe Bilverstone: that is such a cool name. I don't know if your mum has told you about the study yet, but I'm just going to run through a bit of the information with you. Now, just to check you understand everything. And then, after that, you can tell me if you agree to participate in the study. Does that sound? Okay?

5
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.940
Tosha Albor: Okay.

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:37.379
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. So I'll share my screen. Just so you're able to see what I'm reading out, because I don't know about you. But I sometimes prefer to see something visually opposed to someone just reading at me. So if I just share my screen.

7
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.009
Chloe Bilverstone: so you should be able to see

8
00:00:40.280 --> 00:01:05.059
Chloe Bilverstone: my screen. Now, yeah, so essentially, I'm part of a team of researchers at the University College in London. And we're just doing a little bit of research to help us understand a bit more about parent adolescent relationships. So parents and their children, between sort of 11 and 15 years old and communication so essentially, the study involves you playing an online game today with your mum for 8 min.

9
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:22.150
Chloe Bilverstone: we're going to use Zoom to record a video of your playing. Don't worry. The game doesn't require any gaming skill. The rules are very simple and will be explained before we start. It's designed to be fun. I've had a bit of a go myself. I think it was. I think it's quite fun, so hopefully you will, too.

10
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:47.239
Chloe Bilverstone: All of the information, as I said, will be kept safe and secure. No one outside of the research team will see your video. And the only time we would tell someone is, if we are worried about your safety, which I'm sure will not be an issue today. So do you have to take part? No, it is completely up to you, so you can have a chat with Mum. Now you can let me know if you have any questions. If you do decide you would like to take part. We can get going with a video. If you don't want to take part, you can let me know.

11
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.079
Chloe Bilverstone: And also, if we start and you feel that you don't want to continue. You can let me know as well. So do you feel happy to continue?

12
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.899
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, and do you have any sort of questions.

13
00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:01.040
Tosha Albor: No.

14
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.240
Chloe Bilverstone: No perfect. So I'll just stop sharing my screen

15
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.139
Chloe Bilverstone: brilliant. So I'm now gonna just send a link into the chat.

16
00:02:10.812 --> 00:02:15.820
Chloe Bilverstone: Which is the link to the game. So if I just pop that in for you.

17
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.679
Chloe Bilverstone: does that come up in the chat.

18
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:27.420
Tosha Albor: Yep, so I've clicked it already. Kiddo, let me just move this so you can see this is.

19
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.339
Chloe Bilverstone: So it should give you the option to choose between keyboard and touch screen. So you can choose the one that applies.

20
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.630
Tosha Albor: Screen. Oh, I don't think. Well, the touch screen! Well.

21
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.980
Tosha Albor: hmm! How would? How? What is keyboard then?

22
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.211
Chloe Bilverstone: So keyboard is, if you've got like

23
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.170
Tosha Albor: Oh!

24
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.629
Chloe Bilverstone: You know, like a computer. So yeah, feel free to just choose which one.

25
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.570
Tosha Albor: I'm not good at keyboard.

26
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.429
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, it's just sort of 2 keys. And would you be able to share your screen with me?

27
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.870
Tosha Albor: Yeah, please.

28
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.119
Chloe Bilverstone: Brilliant. Yeah, I can see that.

29
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.150
Chloe Bilverstone: So

30
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:22.472
Chloe Bilverstone: let me just get back on there. So I'm not very good with how zoom mirrors it. But essentially, Cosmo, you should be on the left, I believe. To make it work best for you guys. Because essentially what is gonna happen is

31
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.259
Chloe Bilverstone: Tosha, you're going to draw lines with the O. And M. Keys, and then.

32
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.909
Tosha Albor: It's me!

33
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.190
Chloe Bilverstone: Cosmo is going to do that with the A.

34
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.920
Tosha Albor: d 3D.

35
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.840
Chloe Bilverstone: Whichever way is sort of left and right.

36
00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:43.789
Chloe Bilverstone: So if I just read the instructions out hopefully, it will start to make a little bit of sense. So this is, etch a sketch. Have you ever heard of? Etch a sketch before?

37
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.100
Tosha Albor: No.

38
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.730
Chloe Bilverstone: No Susan.

39
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.650
Tosha Albor: Yeah, yeah.

40
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.749
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. So years ago, there used to be a toy called etch a sketch. And essentially, it's a drawing toy.

41
00:03:54.155 --> 00:04:00.280
Chloe Bilverstone: This is it. But online. So it's very similar. And you should be able to see a picture on the left of the house.

42
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.640
Tosha Albor: Yeah.

43
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:25.409
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. So essentially, we'd like you to copy that onto the edge of sketch by working together. But there are some rules. So I'll just let you know those now. So, as I said, Tosha, you can draw lines that are vertical. So up and down by pressing the O. And M. Keys, and then, Cosmo, you can make horizontal lines going side by side by pressing the A and D keys. But what is important is that you don't touch each other's keys.

44
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:49.670
Chloe Bilverstone: So that's the thing to remember. There, if you think at any point you want to clear it and start over, you should be able to see a button new at the sort of top right hand corner there, that will sort of light up. Once you start drawing, you should be able to click that so you can press that at any point throughout the game. If you do find that you sort of finish, and the time isn't up, then feel free to

45
00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:54.900
Chloe Bilverstone: yeah. Do a new one again. So you'll be playing for the full 8 min.

46
00:04:55.317 --> 00:05:08.099
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, I will mute myself, and I'll hide my video to avoid any distractions. But I am here if you need anything. So yeah, just shout if you have any questions. Yeah, so does everything sound? Okay.

47
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.200
Tosha Albor: Yes, but we're allowed to talk as long as we don't touch each other's.

48
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:25.709
Chloe Bilverstone: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, please talk. Please, please engage. Yeah, we should have a work together to try and draw the house. But essentially. Yeah, you must stay to your 2 keys and not touch each other's keys. So I will get my timer set up now, so it'll be.

49
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.750
Tosha Albor: And you're just.

50
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.600
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, Cosmo, do you have any questions, or are you happy to.

51
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.510
Tosha Albor: I'm happy.

52
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:44.469
Chloe Bilverstone: Happy to go. Yeah, I will set the timer, and I will turn my camera and microphone off. But yeah, like, I said, if you have any questions, just let me know, and then I'll come back on after the 8 min. Brilliant.

53
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.710
Chloe Bilverstone: Let's go.

54
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:57.320
Tosha Albor: How do you want to do it, Bob? I don't really know how this works. So let's practice. Let's see what's going on. Well, I'm pressing my keys, but it's actually not moving anything.

55
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.360
Tosha Albor: Oh, oh, that's not good.

56
00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:05.239
Tosha Albor: was it not? Is it?

57
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.309
Chloe Bilverstone: Not working.

58
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.680
Tosha Albor: Oh, now it is okay. So there's there's my line, honey. So I've started that. But I could

59
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.870
Tosha Albor: go down. I could

60
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:27.900
Tosha Albor: also click new. If you want to start from scratch because you want to center it, I want to center it. Are you sure you want to erase and create a new sketch. Sure. All right, let's try that again.

61
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.589
Tosha Albor: So okay, wait. Let me just yeah.

62
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.470
Tosha Albor: Just letting the cat in one moment. One moment

63
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.169
Tosha Albor: we're being timed kiddo, too. So alright.

64
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.829
Tosha Albor: okay. So let's see where I'm at again. O. And M.

65
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.250
Tosha Albor: Oh, it sort of starts there. But what we can do is

66
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:58.559
Tosha Albor: I wonder where it will start. You want to just start where it lets us. You want to try your keys, Hun. See where your keys are. Yeah, okay.

67
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.640
Tosha Albor: okay?

68
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:12.590
Tosha Albor: All right, let's go with that. So do you want to keep going? Yeah, which part of the house is that it's probably the ceiling. Yeah. Okay? So

69
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.670
Tosha Albor: maybe go a bit left.

70
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.190
Tosha Albor: We'll try. Okay.

71
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.549
Tosha Albor: okay, is that enough for more? That feels that feels about right. Should I have a go?

72
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.590
Tosha Albor: M. Down. Oh, oh, cool.

73
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:47.780
Tosha Albor: all right. And then oh, my goodness, mommy, how are you doing? Well? Are we doing a sideways house? No, we're not. We're copying that house, I think. Let's try and forget we made that mistake there. But I don't know. This is gonna work.

74
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:55.909
Tosha Albor: Oh, so it's like the lines have to connect. Yeah, that feels like

75
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.429
Tosha Albor: you're gonna do something on the floor.

76
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:10.382
Tosha Albor: Do you want to? Maybe do the door since? Yeah, we're on the floor. But how would we get to the door? Well, maybe you can go back to the left you mean like with a,

77
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.430
Tosha Albor: yeah, looks like it's turning back, there. Yeah, it does. Yeah. You feel free to go. To which point I will

78
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:24.679
Tosha Albor: add the vertical line for the okay. Cool up is, oh.

79
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:33.449
Tosha Albor: sort of halfway up, isn't it? Yeah, okay, go for it. And then we go. D, no, yeah. D

80
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.700
Tosha Albor: 3

81
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.179
Tosha Albor: m down alright, and then we go d

82
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.790
Tosha Albor: nice to just get back together.

83
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.980
Tosha Albor: That looks good.

84
00:08:52.157 --> 00:09:02.830
Tosha Albor: How we're gonna be able to do diagonals. Yeah 100.

85
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:10.169
Tosha Albor: Let me go back down, I think. Oh, wait! Oh, right return a.

86
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.075
Tosha Albor: Oh.

87
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:29.049
Tosha Albor: okay, that's a little bit weird. But well, how about you keep you wanna try doing diagonals. You wanna try and get to the opposite end, and we'll give the roof the actual triangle roof a go. Okay? Alright.

88
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:36.149
Tosha Albor: Okay. Now, do you think? Oh, wait! We can't touch these other keys, but we can try and do.

89
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:44.909
Tosha Albor: Should we try and do if you do a right? And I do an up at the same time, you think that's going to give us a diagonal. Yeah, 3, 2, 1.

90
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.920
Tosha Albor: Oh, that didn't work. Should we try that again?

91
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.890
Tosha Albor: Yeah.

92
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:59.780
Tosha Albor: maybe maybe it's a shift. There are no other keys. I don't think. Hon, let's just 2 steps going up and you reckon.

93
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:05.289
Tosha Albor: yes, sure, okay, go for it, so then we go.

94
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.219
Tosha Albor: D yeah. So O,

95
00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:20.370
Tosha Albor: DODO, DD alright d, okay, and then i'm, gonna go down.

96
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.379
Tosha Albor: and you still keep going d isn't, it hold up. I'm an M.

97
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.820
Tosha Albor: D.

98
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.970
Tosha Albor: D.

99
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.200
Tosha Albor: The the

100
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.410
Tosha Albor: okay.

101
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.520
Tosha Albor: Oh, yeah. TDD nice. Alright. Now.

102
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:52.030
Tosha Albor: which elements do you wanna head the windows? How are you supposed to do that? Well, I'm the down right now, aren't I? So let me go down to where I think the windows can start.

103
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.129
Tosha Albor: Alright. I think I'm where the windows can line up. I think we need you to go

104
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.610
Tosha Albor: to the left. Okay?

105
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:04.050
Tosha Albor: A. We can at least make the crosses, can't we?

106
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.019
Tosha Albor: Yeah, at least.

107
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:15.960
Tosha Albor: how how long? Don't know. Let's see where that 1st cross is. Oh, yeah, that's that. Looks about right. Now go back a little bit. But so I can do the okay, let me do.

108
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.119
Tosha Albor: Oh, I went down, didn't I?

109
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:29.980
Tosha Albor: I mean, you kind of got to do them both. So yeah, that's all right. Okay, is that enough?

110
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.779
Tosha Albor: Do I need to go down again? Yeah, I can't even see where we are. All right. Cool.

111
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:54.010
Tosha Albor: How do we do the circle? Let's just go to the next. How the next window? Yeah, yeah, it's the only way. Wait. Are you in the middle? I don't know where I am anymore. Just keep sure. I thought I lined it up just right, though. So oh, oh, wait! Hold up!

112
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.590
Tosha Albor: You see it move.

113
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.920
Tosha Albor: Yeah.

114
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:06.690
Tosha Albor: And then we can just need to go back to the other side. Oh, I see. Yeah, you don't want to have to make up. You don't have to cross

115
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:14.680
Tosha Albor: across the house. Do you? Okay, hold up? All right. Go on, then. Nice.

116
00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.539
Tosha Albor: Yeah. We computed that line. Okay.

117
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.030
Tosha Albor: is it my turn? Yeah, okay.

118
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.349
Tosha Albor: let's see if we can be level it.

119
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:34.510
Tosha Albor: Oh, okay. So d, I'm gonna say.

120
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:40.609
Tosha Albor: there, nice nice balance. And I think I need you to go back to where you want me to do the vertical line.

121
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:50.820
Tosha Albor: I'm gonna I'm gonna make it the same. So so it will. It will be one key again. That's fine, is it that? Yeah, looks like, actually, okay.

122
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.110
Tosha Albor: go up.

123
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.949
Tosha Albor: Boom, boom. So let's make it

124
00:12:55.110 --> 00:13:04.410
Tosha Albor: the same 2. A. So it's least symmetrical. Yeah, and then ends down alright cool.

125
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.550
Tosha Albor: Now. What?

126
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.779
Tosha Albor: Oh, I forgot to do. The chimney?

127
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.570
Tosha Albor: Oh, yes, show them up there alright cool

128
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:24.340
Tosha Albor: in the middle. Left. I think so. Oh, no, alright. Do you want me to get up there, though? Yeah. Are you sure you want to go back a little bit? Okay.

129
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:30.180
Tosha Albor: are you sure? Oh, no, no, I'm okay. Are you okay?

130
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.909
Tosha Albor: It's good. It's the best I could do.

131
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:44.561
Tosha Albor: Oh, do we have to do the stairs to go back up there. Yeah, I guess really, everything's wrong already. Anyways, we might as well just cut across. Let's cut across and make a chimney.

132
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:52.370
Tosha Albor: Go on, then.

133
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.000
Chloe Bilverstone: So I'm really sorry I'm gonna have to come back in now. That is.

134
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.120
Tosha Albor: Yeah, that is the 8.

135
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:56.470
Tosha Albor: That's right.

136
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.399
Tosha Albor: Our house.

137
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.659
Chloe Bilverstone: How did you find that.

138
00:13:59.544 --> 00:14:02.980
Tosha Albor: Hard because we don't know how to do diagonal lines or make. Oh.

139
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.779
Chloe Bilverstone: It is quite tricky, isn't it? I'm just gonna stop the recording now.
