1
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.179
Adam Sayer: More into language.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.779
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, you should have had a robot voice tell you that it started recording.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:18.739
Chloe Bilverstone: So, Amelia, I don't know how much your dad has told you about the study, but I'm going to give you some information about it now and then. You can let me know if you're okay with going ahead with it.

4
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.110
Adam Sayer: Yes.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.990
Chloe Bilverstone: That sound good? Yes, so I'll just share my screen. Give me 2 seconds. Okay, so you should be able to see

6
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.620
Chloe Bilverstone: my screen. Now.

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:50.039
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. So I'm just going to read sort of read this out to you, but you can read it as well if you like, so essentially as you probably know, I go to a university in London, and I'm in a team looking at testing a new game. That is, we're hoping will help us understand parent and adolescent. So sort of children between the ages of 11 and 15, their relationships and communication.

8
00:00:50.740 --> 00:01:16.629
Chloe Bilverstone: So the study will involve you playing an online game with your dad today for 8 min, we're going to use Zoom to record a video of you playing the game doesn't require any gaming skill. The rules are very simple, and I'll explain them to you before we start in terms of the information you give us. Like, I said, the video will just be kept safe and secure, and no one outside of the research team will see your video.

9
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:24.900
Chloe Bilverstone: You don't have to take part. It's completely up to you. You can let me know if you've got any questions. And yeah, if you do want to take part, we can get going.

10
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.820
Adam Sayer: Oh, yeah.

11
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.379
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, you're happy with it.

12
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.130
Adam Sayer: Go for it.

13
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.620
Chloe Bilverstone: So I will stop sharing my screen now, and I'm gonna just put in the chat a link to the game.

14
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.950
Chloe Bilverstone: If it gives me 2 secs.

15
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.899
Adam Sayer: You won't do it, do you?

16
00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:42.830
Chloe Bilverstone: Okay, right? So.

17
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.390
Adam Sayer: So.

18
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.460
Chloe Bilverstone: It is normally the kids doing it. The parents just have to sit.

19
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.180
Adam Sayer: Depressing.

20
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.400
Adam Sayer: Well, I don't know.

21
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.650
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. And so you click either keyboard or touch screen depending on what device your

22
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.000
Chloe Bilverstone: yeah, is that all opened up.

23
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.880
Adam Sayer: Touch or keyboard, keyboard.

24
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.200
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. And then, Amelia, you sat on the left.

25
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.440
Adam Sayer: Looking at Screamer on the right.

26
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.720
Chloe Bilverstone: So, so I think it'll be easier if she's.

27
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.380
Adam Sayer: Looking at the screen. I'm on the left.

28
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.159
Chloe Bilverstone: So it's best. If she sat on the left.

29
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.420
Adam Sayer: Yourself on the right.

30
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:21.229
Chloe Bilverstone: I can never tell.

31
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.689
Chloe Bilverstone: I can never tell with the Zoom, it sort of reverses it, so I have to ask would just be easier with the keys that you're gonna be using.

32
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.652
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. So I'm looking at the screen on the right hand side now.

33
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.930
Chloe Bilverstone: perfect. So if I just talk you through sort of the rules. So this is the etch a sketch. Have you guys seen etch a sketch before?

34
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.250
Adam Sayer: Yeah.

35
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.380
Chloe Bilverstone: So it's basically the same. But online. And you should be able to see a picture on the left.

36
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.370
Adam Sayer: Yep.

37
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.960
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. So we're gonna like you to copy that picture onto the etch, a sketch by working together. But there are some rules.

38
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.350
Adam Sayer: Thank you

39
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:05.839
Adam Sayer: so not hard rules. So, Adam, you can only draw lines that are vertical. So up and down by pressing the O. And M. Keys.

40
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.730
Adam Sayer: Yep.

41
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:16.450
Chloe Bilverstone: And then, Amelia, you can only make horizontal lines, so go in side by side by pressing the A and D keys, and the important thing to remember is, you're not allowed to touch each other's keys.

42
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.900
Adam Sayer: Oh!

43
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:27.819
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, so Adam O. And M. Keys and Amelia A and D keys if you want to, at any point, you can clear it and start over, so there should be a.

44
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.830
Adam Sayer: And shake it.

45
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.050
Chloe Bilverstone: That would be quite cool, actually.

46
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.150
Adam Sayer: That way. It is, yeah.

47
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.060
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, but no, it's a bit more boring option. So there's a should be a button at the top right.

48
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.010
Adam Sayer: Yeah, yeah.

49
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:47.951
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, that'll become clickable. You'll play for 8 min. And I will meet myself. Hide my videos so I won't hopefully distract you, but I am here. If you need anything. If you've got any

50
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:56.040
Adam Sayer: If you are finished before the time is up. If you could just sort of keep playing so just restart it again. We just essentially want you to be playing for the full 8 min.

51
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.909
Adam Sayer: Yeah, no worries.

52
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.410
Chloe Bilverstone: I'll speak to you to tell you when the time is up. And then that's the only part we use for our research. I'll stop recording at that point.

53
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.030
Adam Sayer: No worries.

54
00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:05.840
Chloe Bilverstone: Is everything clear? Do you have any questions?

55
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.240
Adam Sayer: No, it should be all right, should we?

56
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.059
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, are you able to share your screen?

57
00:04:10.636 --> 00:04:11.860
Chloe Bilverstone: Just so I can.

58
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.820
Adam Sayer: Come on in, baby.

59
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.769
Adam Sayer: Where is it you got me on here, aren't you.

60
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.149
Chloe Bilverstone: So the bottom it should be on zoom.

61
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.680
Chloe Bilverstone: Go back on zoom.

62
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.690
Adam Sayer: Yeah.

63
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.790
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. And then at the bottom there should be the share.

64
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.230
Adam Sayer: We got it.

65
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.330
Chloe Bilverstone: Got it.

66
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.110
Chloe Bilverstone: We're wrong.

67
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.490
Chloe Bilverstone: Yep, and then you get to go back on the game.

68
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:56.240
Adam Sayer: Good luck with that. I can't see. I can't see it.

69
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.410
Chloe Bilverstone: You can exits there.

70
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.529
Adam Sayer: There you go. Yeah.

71
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.050
Chloe Bilverstone: Perfect. Right? So I'm gonna get the time up.

72
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.300
Adam Sayer: Oh, it starts! There.

73
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.290
Chloe Bilverstone: You guys all ready to go.

74
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.410
Adam Sayer: Yeah.

75
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.120
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, perfect. Okay, I'll start the timer. Now.

76
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.190
Adam Sayer: Not them.

77
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.620
Adam Sayer: I can't go down all down.

78
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.819
Adam Sayer: Come and stop.

79
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.030

Adam Sayer: Hope!

84
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:57.729
Adam Sayer: Behold, I think we have to press them at the same time. So if you press up no, you need to go up. 3, 2, 1.

85
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.670
Adam Sayer: You meant to press it. I hold it. You're over there now, I know.

86
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.870
Adam Sayer: Oh, my God!

87
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.690
Adam Sayer: We'll practice on this 1 2 min press. Oh, yeah, hold it down.

Adam Sayer: Yeah, oh, too big. Not that way.

131
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.960
Adam Sayer: We may need to make it smaller. Stop, good!

132
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.860
Adam Sayer: How do you make circles.

133
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.640
Adam Sayer: I think you can awesome.

134

Adam Sayer: where are you? Press it once.

141
00:12:30.564 --> 00:12:40.089
Adam Sayer: and then if you go down good all the way down, keep on going.

142
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.860
Adam Sayer: If you go all the way down, and then we press. No. Then it will start there

143
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.960
Adam Sayer: and then, I guess.

144
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.959
Adam Sayer: So stop and go up.

145
00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:00.120
Adam Sayer: Let me know one more. Yeah.

146
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:08.160
Adam Sayer: let's go. You go right. I'll go up. Ready. 3, 2, 1, 3, stop!

147
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.879
Adam Sayer: 3, 2, 1 good!

148
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.910
Adam Sayer: Stop! Hey!

149
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.930
Chloe Bilverstone: So that is the 8 min up.

150
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:15.630
Adam Sayer: Really.

151
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.499
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, it's cool.

152
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.600
Chloe Bilverstone: Get it?

153
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.620
Adam Sayer: Yeah, I didn't.

154
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.310
Chloe Bilverstone: You find it.

155
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.139
Adam Sayer: Yeah, it's good. It's hard to do, though.

156
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.690
Chloe Bilverstone: Together. It's quite difficult. I'm just gonna stop recording now.
