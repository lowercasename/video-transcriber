1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
Chloe Bilverstone: So I'm just

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:19.990
Chloe Bilverstone: should have had a robot tell you that we're now recording. So you and I don't know how much your mum's told you about the study, but I'm going to just talk you through it now, and like what will happen, and then you can let me know if you want to proceed with it, so I'll just start sharing my screen. Give me 2 secs

3
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.819
Chloe Bilverstone: and bring that up. So can you see a document there.

4
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.780
Lis McDonald: Yeah.

5
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:45.769
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. So I'm going to read out. But just in case you prefer to read yourself. But essentially, I go to a university in London. And I'm part of a team that are trying out this new game to help us understand parent and adolescent relationships and communication. So in terms of what the study involves. Essentially, you'll play an online game today with your mum for 8 min.

6
00:00:45.770 --> 00:01:04.400
Chloe Bilverstone: We're going to be using Zoom to record a video of you playing. It doesn't require any gaming skill. The rules are very simple, and I'll explain to you both before we get started in terms of the information you give us. So the the video, like I said, will be kept safe and secure, and no one outside of the research team will see the video.

7
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:19.660
Chloe Bilverstone: You don't have to take part. It is completely up to you, and you can let me know if you have any questions. If you do decide to take part. We can get going with the game now, if not, you can let me know, and if you decide halfway through you want to stop as well, you can also do that. Are you happy to proceed.

8
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.680
Lis McDonald: Yeah.

9
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.940
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, perfect. So I'll stop sharing my screen. And I'm now just gonna put in the chat. The link to the game.

10
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.529
Chloe Bilverstone: Me to use sex.

11
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:44.080
Chloe Bilverstone: So pop that in there now. So if you can just open the link up and it should give you the option to either click keyboard or touch screen and you can obviously click which one is applicable to you.

12
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.140
Lis McDonald: Hmm.

13
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.589
Chloe Bilverstone: Does that come up? Okay.

14
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.570
Lis McDonald: Yeah.

15
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.170
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah. And then, are you able to share your screen with me again? Please.

16
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.890
Lis McDonald: Yeah.

17
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.360
Chloe Bilverstone: Thank you.

18
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.830
Lis McDonald: Right.

19
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.489
Chloe Bilverstone: There you have. If you go back onto zoom, and then it should be at the bottom again.

20
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.550
Lis McDonald: It disappeared.

21
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.120
Chloe Bilverstone: What zoom has disappeared, or.

22
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.530
Lis McDonald: You're there, but they.

23
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:32.479
Chloe Bilverstone: So if you go like on the bottom of your screen is that, can you see the zoom app, or the or you doing it through the end, through like your browser.

24
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.480
Lis McDonald: I'm sorry. Hold it in. I got it.

25
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.960
Lis McDonald: There we go. Got it.

26
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.439
Chloe Bilverstone: Got it. Yeah. And then, if you could, just yeah, share your screen, that would be Fab

27
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.459
Chloe Bilverstone: perfect. So I think that's just

28
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:59.770
Chloe Bilverstone: coming through now. So yeah, brilliant. So you should be able to see an etch, a sketch on the screen. Have you guys seen an etch sketch before?

29
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.200
Lis McDonald: Yeah.

30
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:18.230
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, so it's basically the same as the physical one. But online. And essentially, we would like you to copy the picture you should see on the left to the house onto etch a sketch by working together. But there are some rules to it.

31
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:34.759
Chloe Bilverstone: So, Liz, you can only draw lines a vertical. So up and down by pressing the O. And the M. Keys, and then you and you can only make horizontal lines. So, going side by side by pressing the A and d keys so I don't know if you like the right way around. I think.

32
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.802
Lis McDonald: No, we're not.

33
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.466
Chloe Bilverstone: If you want to swap, swap round.

34
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.009
Chloe Bilverstone: There we go. And essentially the most important thing to remember is you can't touch each other's keys.

35
00:03:48.188 --> 00:04:11.020
Chloe Bilverstone: So yeah, like I, said, Liz O and M. Keys, and you and A. And d keys if you want to, at any point you can restart it. So there is a at the top, right there is a button, a new button. You should be able to see and once you start drawing, that will become like clickable. And you can yeah restart at any point you're gonna be playing for 8 min.

36
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:33.690
Chloe Bilverstone: if you do finish beforehand, if you can, just like restart and play again. Essentially, we just want you to be playing for the full 8 min. If that's okay, I will turn my camera off my microphone off so hopefully, I won't distract but if you have got any issues, just obviously say, and I can come back on I'm gonna get a timer up. And yeah, that's it. Do you sort of have any questions? Or does it all make sense.

37
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.070
Lis McDonald: Yeah.

38
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:45.540
Chloe Bilverstone: Yeah, okay, I'll just get my timer ready. So yeah, like, I said, I'll turn my camera off, and then I'll come back on after the 8 min, so I'll press start now.

39
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.120
Lis McDonald: Every reason I have to do it.

40
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.440
Lis McDonald: Yeah, efforts go

41
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.790
Lis McDonald: 9.

42
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.979
Chloe Bilverstone: Or is it not? Is it not working?

43
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.476
Chloe Bilverstone: Well, I think I think I've lost you guys.

44
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.610
Chloe Bilverstone: Can you guys hear me? I can't hear you. Can you hear me?

45
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.850
Lis McDonald: Yeah.

46
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.439
Chloe Bilverstone: Oh, you're sort of cutting out a little bit.

47
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.320
Lis McDonald: Well.

48
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.350
Chloe Bilverstone: Oh, I think you're back now. I think it was sort of it was cutting out. Is it not working the game.

49
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.480
Lis McDonald: It just says, Internet connection is unstable. That's just the.

50
00:05:59.968 --> 00:06:03.929
Chloe Bilverstone: You're back! You're back now. I can hear you now. So is the game. Is the game not working.

51
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.690
Lis McDonald: No.

52
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.600
Chloe Bilverstone: Oh!

53
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.700
Lis McDonald: Yeah, no, I'm pressing over. And M.

54
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.480
Chloe Bilverstone: Have you tried like sort of click, using the mouse and click on like the middle of the screen.

55
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.500
Chloe Bilverstone: and then try.

56
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.200
Lis McDonald: Think? No, it just makes the noise.

57
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.090
Chloe Bilverstone: That is. Oh, is it drawing now? I think it's drawing now. I can see a line.

58
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.310
Lis McDonald: We can't see anything.

59
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.360
Chloe Bilverstone: Oh!

60
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.420
Lis McDonald: A little the dial things move, but we can't see any lines at all.

61
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:51.739
Chloe Bilverstone: That is weird. Maybe. Re, if we if you go off the page and then re, click the link. I'm sorry about that. That's not happened before. So I'm not sure why it's done that. Yeah, maybe if you like, refresh it and see if that works.

62
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.450
Lis McDonald: He is right.

63
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.700
Lis McDonald: How are you guys?

64
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.150
Lis McDonald: This is just commit.

65
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.830
Lis McDonald: Yeah, come off a bit. And then no, hmm.

66
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.809
Lis McDonald: Perhaps that was in the way, maybe just try and hold on

67
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.050
Lis McDonald: right?

68
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.200

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.880
Lis McDonald: Hold!

Chloe Bilverstone: Okay, Fab, I will reset the timer.

80
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:21.620
Lis McDonald: Pardon me.

81
00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:27.300
Chloe Bilverstone: So if I just get the time up, yeah, are you guys ready to go.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:09.000
Lis McDonald: Oh, I'm gonna press a 3 a 1.

135
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.980
Lis McDonald: No?

136
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.870
Lis McDonald: Oh, my gosh, no! Don't keep embracing that.

137
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:22.989
Lis McDonald: It's a tiled roof ready. You're not going to get a straight line, and it's perfect to do an extra stretch.

138
