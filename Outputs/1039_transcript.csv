text,speaker,start,end
 So she should have had a robot tell you that the recording is in progress; perfect.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:00,0:00:06.440000
 So is it Cosmo; I believe?,SPEAKER_00,0:00:06.440000,0:00:09.320000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:09.320000,0:00:10.320000
 That is such a cool name.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:10.320000,0:00:11.520000
 I don't know if your mum has told you about the study yet; but I'm just going to run,SPEAKER_00,0:00:11.520000,0:00:14.440000
 through a bit of the information with you now just to check you understand everything.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:14.440000,0:00:18.800000
 And then after that; you can tell me if you agree to participate in the study; does that,SPEAKER_00,0:00:18.800000,0:00:22.080000
 sound okay?,SPEAKER_00,0:00:22.080000,0:00:23.080000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:23.080000,0:00:24.080000
 Yeah; so I'll share my screen just so you're able to see what I'm reading out because,SPEAKER_00,0:00:24.080000,0:00:28.080000
 I don't know about you; but I sometimes refer to see something visually opposed to someone,SPEAKER_00,0:00:28.080000,0:00:32.960000
 just reading at me.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:32.960000,0:00:34.360000
 So if I just share my screen; so you should be able to see the screen now.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:34.360000,0:00:41.680000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:41.680000,0:00:42.680000
 So essentially I'm part of a team of researchers at the University College in London and we're,SPEAKER_00,0:00:42.680000,0:00:48.160000
 just doing a little bit of research to help us understand a bit more about parent adolescent,SPEAKER_00,0:00:48.160000,0:00:52.760000
 relationships; so parents and their children between sort of 11 and 15 years old and communication.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:52.760000,0:00:59.600000
 So essentially the study involves you playing an online game today with your mum for eight,SPEAKER_00,0:00:59.600000,0:01:04.480000
 minutes.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:04.480000,0:01:05.480000
 We're going to use Zoom to record a video of you're playing.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:05.480000,0:01:09.360000
 Don't worry; the game doesn't require any gaming skill.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:09.360000,0:01:12.200000
 The rules are very simple and we'll be explained before we start.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:12.200000,0:01:16.280000
 It's designed to be fun.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:16.280000,0:01:17.600000
 I've had a bit of a go myself.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:17.600000,0:01:18.800000
 I think it was; I think it's quite fun.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:18.800000,0:01:20.400000
 So hopefully you will too.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:20.400000,0:01:23.080000
 All of the information; as I said; will be kept safe and secure.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:23.080000,0:01:25.880000
 No one outside of the research team will see your video and the only time you would tell,SPEAKER_00,0:01:25.880000,0:01:29.840000
 someone is if we are worried about your safety; which I'm sure will not be an issue today.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:29.840000,0:01:34.560000
 So do you have to take part?,SPEAKER_00,0:01:34.560000,0:01:36.320000
 No; it is completely up to you.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:36.320000,0:01:37.880000
 So you can have a chat with your mum now.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:37.880000,0:01:39.280000
 You can let me know if you have any questions.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:39.280000,0:01:41.480000
 If you do decide you would like to take part; we can get going with a video.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:41.480000,0:01:45.320000
 If you don't want to take part; you can let me know.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:45.320000,0:01:47.440000
 And also if we start and you feel that you don't want to continue; you can let me know,SPEAKER_00,0:01:47.440000,0:01:50.880000
 as well.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:50.880000,0:01:51.880000
 So do you feel happy to continue?,SPEAKER_00,0:01:51.880000,0:01:54.520000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:54.520000,0:01:55.520000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:55.520000,0:01:56.520000
 And do you have any sort of questions?,SPEAKER_00,0:01:56.520000,0:01:59.520000
 Ah; no.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:59.520000,0:02:00.520000
 No?,SPEAKER_00,0:02:00.520000,0:02:01.520000
 Perfect.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:01.520000,0:02:02.520000
 So I'll just stop sharing my screen.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:02.520000,0:02:05.520000
 Brilliant.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:05.520000,0:02:06.520000
 So I'm now going to just send a link into the chat; which is the link to the game.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:06.520000,0:02:13.160000
 So if I just pop that in for you; does that come up in the chat?,SPEAKER_00,0:02:13.160000,0:02:17.400000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:02:17.400000,0:02:18.400000
 So I've clicked it already.,SPEAKER_01,0:02:18.400000,0:02:22.400000
 Mm-hmm.,SPEAKER_01,0:02:22.400000,0:02:23.400000
 Is the game a kiddo?,SPEAKER_01,0:02:23.400000,0:02:24.400000
 Let me just move this so you can see.,SPEAKER_01,0:02:24.400000,0:02:26.400000
 So it should give you the option to choose between keyboard and touch screen so you can,SPEAKER_00,0:02:26.400000,0:02:30.720000
 choose the one that applies.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:30.720000,0:02:32.720000
 Oh.,SPEAKER_01,0:02:32.720000,0:02:33.720000
 I don't think all my touch screen; well; how; what is keyboard then?,SPEAKER_01,0:02:33.720000,0:02:39.760000
 This one?,SPEAKER_01,0:02:39.760000,0:02:40.760000
 The keyboard is if you've got like; um; the key; you know; like a computer.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:40.760000,0:02:44.640000
 So yeah; feel free to just choose which one.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:44.640000,0:02:46.960000
 I'm not going to keyboard.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:46.960000,0:02:48.600000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:48.600000,0:02:49.600000
 Just be arrows.,SPEAKER_01,0:02:49.600000,0:02:50.600000
 Yeah; it's just sort of two; um; keys; um; and would you be able to share your screen,SPEAKER_00,0:02:50.600000,0:02:56.600000
 with me?,SPEAKER_00,0:02:56.600000,0:02:57.600000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:57.600000,0:02:58.600000
 Please.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:58.600000,0:02:59.600000
 Brilliant.,UNKNOWN,0:02:59.600000,0:03:01.600000
 Yeah; I can see that.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:01.600000,0:03:06.600000
 So; um; let me just get back on there.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:06.600000,0:03:09.840000
 So I'm not very good with how zoom mirrors it; but essentially; um; Cosmo; you should be,SPEAKER_00,0:03:09.840000,0:03:14.440000
 on the left; I believe; um; to make it work best for you guys; um; because essentially;,SPEAKER_00,0:03:14.440000,0:03:20.440000
 what is going to happen is; um; Tosha; you're going to draw lines; uh; with the open M keys,SPEAKER_00,0:03:20.440000,0:03:27.120000
 and then Cosmo is going to do that with the; uh; A and D; whichever way is sort of.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:27.120000,0:03:35.120000
 I loved them.,SPEAKER_01,0:03:35.120000,0:03:36.120000
 Right.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:36.120000,0:03:37.120000
 Um; so if I just read the instructions; that hopefully it will start to make a little,SPEAKER_00,0:03:37.120000,0:03:39.440000
 bit of sense.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:39.440000,0:03:40.440000
 So this is edge of sketch.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:40.440000,0:03:41.760000
 Have you ever heard of edge of sketch before?,SPEAKER_00,0:03:41.760000,0:03:43.720000
 No; no; so yeah; so; um; years ago; there used to be a toy; um; called edge of sketch.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:44.200000,0:03:51.680000
 And essentially; it's a drawing toy; um; this is it; but online; it's very similar; um;,SPEAKER_00,0:03:51.680000,0:03:57.400000
 and you should be able to see a picture on the left of the house.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:57.400000,0:04:00.400000
 Yeah.,UNKNOWN,0:04:00.400000,0:04:01.400000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:01.400000,0:04:02.400000
 Um; so; um; essentially; we'd like you to copy that onto the edge of sketch by working,SPEAKER_00,0:04:02.400000,0:04:07.280000
 together; but there are some rules.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:07.280000,0:04:09
 So I'll just let you know those now.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:09,0:04:11.080000
 So as I said; Tosha; you can draw lines that are vertical; so up and down by pressing,SPEAKER_00,0:04:11.080000,0:04:14.960000
 the open M keys; um; and then Cosmo; you can make horizontal lines; go inside by side,SPEAKER_00,0:04:14.960000,0:04:20
 by pressing the A and D keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:20,0:04:22.360000
 But what is important is that you don't touch each other's keys; so that's the thing,SPEAKER_00,0:04:22.360000,0:04:26.640000
 to remember there.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:26.640000,0:04:27.920000
 Um; if you think at any point you want to clear it and start over; um; you should be,SPEAKER_00,0:04:27.920000,0:04:32.600000
 able to see a button new at the top right hand corner there; um; that will sort of,SPEAKER_00,0:04:32.600000,0:04:38.520000
 light up once you start drawing; you should be able to click that; um; so you can press,SPEAKER_00,0:04:38.520000,0:04:42.480000
 that at any point; um; throughout the game.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:42.480000,0:04:44.880000
 Um; if you do find that you sort of finish; um; and the time isn't up; then feel free,SPEAKER_00,0:04:44.880000,0:04:48.960000
 to; um; yeah; do a new one; um; again; um; so you'll be playing for the full eight minutes.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:48.960000,0:04:55.200000
 Um; yeah; I will meet myself; and I'll hide my video to avoid any distractions; but I,SPEAKER_00,0:04:55.200000,0:04:59.880000
 am here if you need anything.,SPEAKER_00,0:04:59.880000,0:05:01.200000
 So; um; yeah; just shout if you have any questions.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:01.200000,0:05:04.960000
 Um; yeah.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:04.960000,0:05:05.960000
 So; does everything sound okay?,SPEAKER_00,0:05:05.960000,0:05:07.960000
 Yes; but we're allowed to talk as long as we don't touch each other's keys.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:07.960000,0:05:11.400000
 Oh; yeah; yeah; yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:11.400000,0:05:12.400000
 Yeah; please talk; please; please engage; um; yeah; we each have a work together to try,SPEAKER_00,0:05:12.400000,0:05:16.200000
 and draw the house; but essentially; yeah; you must stay for your two keys and not touch,SPEAKER_00,0:05:16.200000,0:05:20.880000
 each other's keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:20.880000,0:05:21.880000
 Um; so I will get my timer set up now; so it'll be for eight minutes; um; yeah; do you,SPEAKER_00,0:05:21.880000,0:05:29.160000
 have any questions or are you happy to; um; happy to go; yeah; yeah; I will set; um;,SPEAKER_00,0:05:29.160000,0:05:35.840000
 the timer; and I'll turn my camera on microphone off; but yeah; like I said; if you have any,SPEAKER_00,0:05:35.840000,0:05:40
 questions; just let me know.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:40,0:05:41.400000
 And then I'll come back on after the eight minutes.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:41.400000,0:05:43.400000
 Brilliant.,UNKNOWN,0:05:43.400000,0:05:44.400000
 Let's go.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:44.400000,0:05:45.400000
 All right.,SPEAKER_00,0:05:45.400000,0:05:46.400000
 How do you want to do it; Bob?,SPEAKER_01,0:05:46.400000,0:05:48.640000
 Uh; I don't really know how to swap.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:48.640000,0:05:51.440000
 So; let's practice.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:51.440000,0:05:52.440000
 Let's see what's going on.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:52.440000,0:05:53.440000
 Well; I'm pressing my keys; but it's actually not moving anything.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:53.440000,0:05:57.040000
 Oh; that's not good.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:57.040000,0:06:01.080000
 Um; was it not; is it not walk in?,SPEAKER_01,0:06:01.080000,0:06:06.080000
 Oh; now it is.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:06.080000,0:06:07.080000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:07.080000,0:06:08.080000
 So there's; there's my line; honey.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:08.080000,0:06:10.440000
 So I've started that; but I could go down; I could also click new; if you want to start,SPEAKER_01,0:06:10.440000,0:06:18.720000
 to scratch.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:18.720000,0:06:19.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:19.720000,0:06:20.720000
 Because you want to center it.,SPEAKER_02,0:06:20.720000,0:06:21.720000
 Uh; I want to center it.,SPEAKER_02,0:06:21.720000,0:06:22.720000
 Are you sure you want to erase and create a new sketch?,SPEAKER_02,0:06:22.720000,0:06:25.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:25.720000,0:06:26.720000
 All right.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:26.720000,0:06:27.720000
 Let's try that again.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:27.720000,0:06:28.720000
 So.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:28.720000,0:06:29.720000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_02,0:06:29.720000,0:06:30.720000
 Wait.,SPEAKER_02,0:06:30.720000,0:06:31.720000
 Let me just.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:31.720000,0:06:32.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:32.720000,0:06:33.720000
 Just letting the pattern.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:33.720000,0:06:36.720000
 We're being timed; kiddo; too.,SPEAKER_02,0:06:36.720000,0:06:40.720000
 So.,UNKNOWN,0:06:40.720000,0:06:41.720000
 All right.,UNKNOWN,0:06:41.720000,0:06:42.720000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:42.720000,0:06:43.720000
 So let's see where I'm at again.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:43.720000,0:06:45.720000
 Oh; and M.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:45.720000,0:06:46.720000
 Oh; it sort of starts there.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:46.720000,0:06:48.720000
 But what we can do is.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:48.720000,0:06:50.720000
 I wonder where we'll start.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:50.720000,0:06:52.720000
 You want to just start where it lets us.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:52.720000,0:06:54.720000
 You want to try your keys; huh?,SPEAKER_01,0:06:54.720000,0:06:55.720000
 See where your keys are.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:55.720000,0:06:56.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:56.720000,0:06:57.720000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:06:57.720000,0:07:00.720000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:00.720000,0:07:01.720000
 All right.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:01.720000,0:07:02.720000
 Let's go with that.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:02.720000,0:07:03.720000
 So.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:03.720000,0:07:04.720000
 Do you want to keep going?,SPEAKER_01,0:07:04.720000,0:07:05.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:05.720000,0:07:06.720000
 Which part of the house is that?,SPEAKER_01,0:07:06.720000,0:07:08.720000
 It's probably the ceiling.,SPEAKER_02,0:07:08.720000,0:07:09.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_02,0:07:09.720000,0:07:10.720000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:10.720000,0:07:11.720000
 So.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:11.720000,0:07:12.720000
 Maybe go a bit left.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:12.720000,0:07:15.720000
 Try.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:15.720000,0:07:16.720000
 Okay.,UNKNOWN,0:07:16.720000,0:07:17.720000
 Okay.,UNKNOWN,0:07:17.720000,0:07:18.720000
 Is that enough?,SPEAKER_02,0:07:18.720000,0:07:19.720000
 That feels.,SPEAKER_02,0:07:19.720000,0:07:20.720000
 That feels about right?,SPEAKER_02,0:07:20.720000,0:07:21.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:21.720000,0:07:22.720000
 Should I have a go?,SPEAKER_01,0:07:22.720000,0:07:23.720000
 And down.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:24.720000,0:07:25.720000
 Oh; oh.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:25.720000,0:07:26.720000

 And then.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:29.720000,0:07:30.720000
 Oh; my goodness.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:30.720000,0:07:31.720000
 What are you doing?,SPEAKER_01,0:07:31.720000,0:07:32.720000
 Well.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:32.720000,0:07:33.720000
 Are we doing a sideways house?,SPEAKER_02,0:07:33.720000,0:07:35.720000
 No; we're not.,SPEAKER_02,0:07:35.720000,0:07:36.720000
 We're copying that house.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:36.720000,0:07:37.720000
 Uh;,SPEAKER_01,0:07:37.720000,0:07:38.720000
 I think let's try and forget.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:38.720000,0:07:39.720000
 We made that mistake there.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:39.720000,0:07:41.720000
 So before.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:41.720000,0:07:42.720000
 So that's what.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:42.720000,0:07:43.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:43.720000,0:07:44.720000
 But I don't know.,SPEAKER_02,0:07:44.720000,0:07:45.720000
 This is going to.,SPEAKER_02,0:07:45.720000,0:07:47.720000
 Oh.,UNKNOWN,0:07:47.720000,0:07:48.720000
 So it's like the lines have to connect.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:48.720000,0:07:52.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_02,0:07:52.720000,0:07:53.720000
 That feels like.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:53.720000,0:07:55.720000
 You're going to do something on the floor.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:55.720000,0:07:57.720000
 Do you want to maybe do.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:57.720000,0:07:59.720000
 The door.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:59.720000,0:08:00.720000

 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:01.720000,0:08:02.720000
 We're on the floor.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:02.720000,0:08:03.720000
 But how would we get to the door?,SPEAKER_01,0:08:03.720000,0:08:04.720000
 Well.,UNKNOWN,0:08:04.720000,0:08:05.720000
 Maybe you can go back to the left.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:05.720000,0:08:07.720000
 I mean; like with a.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:07.720000,0:08:09.720000

 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:10.720000,0:08:11.720000
 Looks like it's turning back there.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:11.720000,0:08:13.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:13.720000,0:08:14.720000

 Oh.,UNKNOWN,0:08:24.720000,0:08:25.720000
 Sort of halfway up; isn't it?,SPEAKER_01,0:08:25.720000,0:08:26.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:26.720000,0:08:27.720000

 All right.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:41.720000,0:08:42.720000
 And then we go.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:42.720000,0:08:44.720000
 Nice.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:44.720000,0:08:45.720000
 To just get back to that.,SPEAKER_02,0:08:45.720000,0:08:47.720000
 Mm hmm.,UNKNOWN,0:08:47.720000,0:08:48.720000
 That looks good.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:48.720000,0:08:50.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_02,0:08:50.720000,0:08:51.720000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_02,0:08:51.720000,0:08:52.720000

 Yeah.,SPEAKER_02,0:08:53.720000,0:08:54.720000
 Let's find.,SPEAKER_02,0:08:54.720000,0:08:55.720000
 Good enough.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:55.720000,0:08:56.720000
 Good enough.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:56.720000,0:08:57.720000
 Exactly.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:57.720000,0:08:58.720000
 That can be perfect.,SPEAKER_02,0:08:58.720000,0:08:59.720000
 Is it?,SPEAKER_01,0:08:59.720000,0:09:00.720000
 No.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:00.720000,0:09:01.720000
 Because I don't know how we're going to be able to do diagonals.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:01.720000,0:09:03.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:03.720000,0:09:04.720000

 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:13.720000,0:09:14.720000
 It's a little bit wet.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:14.720000,0:09:16.720000
 But.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:16.720000,0:09:17.720000
 Well;,SPEAKER_01,0:09:17.720000,0:09:18.720000
 how about you keep.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:18.720000,0:09:19.720000
 I'm going to try doing diagonals.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:19.720000,0:09:21.720000
 I'm going to try to get to the opposite end.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:21.720000,0:09:23.720000
 And we'll give the roof the actual triangle move ago.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:23.720000,0:09:27.720000
 Okay.,UNKNOWN,0:09:27.720000,0:09:28.720000

 Oh; wait.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:31.720000,0:09:32.720000
 We can't touch these up other keys.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:32.720000,0:09:33.720000
 But we can try and do.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:33.720000,0:09:37.720000
 Should we try and do.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:37.720000,0:09:38.720000
 If you do a right.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:38.720000,0:09:39.720000
 And I do an up at the same time.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:39.720000,0:09:40.720000
 I think it's going to give us a diagonal.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:40.720000,0:09:42.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:42.720000,0:09:43.720000

 Oh.,SPEAKER_02,0:09:46.720000,0:09:47.720000
 That didn't work.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:47.720000,0:09:49.720000
 So try that again.,SPEAKER_02,0:09:49.720000,0:09:50.720000
 Yeah.,UNKNOWN,0:09:50.720000,0:09:51.720000
 Maybe; maybe it's a shift.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:51.720000,0:09:53.720000
 No; there are no other keys.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:53.720000,0:09:55.720000
 I don't think I'm.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:55.720000,0:09:56.720000
 Let's just do steps going on.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:56.720000,0:09:58.720000
 I reckon.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:58.720000,0:09:59.720000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:59.720000,0:10:00.720000

 Okay; go for it.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:01.720000,0:10:02.720000
 So then we go.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:02.720000,0:10:04.720000
 D.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:04.720000,0:10:05.720000

 Which elements do you want to head?,SPEAKER_01,0:10:41.720000,0:10:43.720000
 The windows.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:43.720000,0:10:44.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:44.720000,0:10:45.720000

 So let me go down to where I think the windows can start.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:48.720000,0:10:51.720000
 All right.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:51.720000,0:10:52.720000
 I think I'm where the windows can line up.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:52.720000,0:10:55.720000
 I think we need you to go to the left.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:55.720000,0:10:58.720000
 Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:58.720000,0:10:59.720000
 A.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:59.720000,0:11:01.720000

 How long?,SPEAKER_01,0:11:06.720000,0:11:07.720000
 I don't know.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:07.720000,0:11:08.720000
 Let's see.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:08.720000,0:11:09.720000
 That first crosses.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:09.720000,0:11:10.720000
 Oh; yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:10.720000,0:11:11.720000

 Boom.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:18.720000,0:11:19.720000
 Oh; I went down; didn't I?,SPEAKER_01,0:11:19.720000,0:11:22.720000
 I mean; you kind of want to do them both.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:22.720000,0:11:25.720000
 Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:25.720000,0:11:26.720000

 That's just goes in the next house.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:37.720000,0:11:38.720000
 The next window.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:38.720000,0:11:39.720000

 This is the last.,SPEAKER_01,0:13:30.720000,0:13:31.720000
 I can do.,SPEAKER_01,0:13:31.720000,0:13:32.720000

 How did you find that?,SPEAKER_00,0:13:56.720000,0:13:58.720000
 Hard because you do not do diagonal lines all make over.,SPEAKER_00,0:13:58.720000,0:14:02.720000
 It is quite tricky; isn't it?,SPEAKER_00,0:14:02.720000,0:14:04.720000
