[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:00 --> 0:00:06.440000]  So she should have had a robot tell you that the recording is in progress, perfect.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:06.440000 --> 0:00:09.320000]  So is it Cosmo, I believe?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:09.320000 --> 0:00:10.320000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:10.320000 --> 0:00:11.520000]  That is such a cool name.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:11.520000 --> 0:00:14.440000]  I don't know if your mum has told you about the study yet, but I'm just going to run

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:14.440000 --> 0:00:18.800000]  through a bit of the information with you now just to check you understand everything.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:18.800000 --> 0:00:22.080000]  And then after that, you can tell me if you agree to participate in the study, does that

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:22.080000 --> 0:00:23.080000]  sound okay?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:23.080000 --> 0:00:24.080000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:24.080000 --> 0:00:28.080000]  Yeah, so I'll share my screen just so you're able to see what I'm reading out because

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:28.080000 --> 0:00:32.960000]  I don't know about you, but I sometimes refer to see something visually opposed to someone

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:32.960000 --> 0:00:34.360000]  just reading at me.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:34.360000 --> 0:00:41.680000]  So if I just share my screen, so you should be able to see the screen now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:41.680000 --> 0:00:42.680000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:42.680000 --> 0:00:48.160000]  So essentially I'm part of a team of researchers at the University College in London and we're

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:48.160000 --> 0:00:52.760000]  just doing a little bit of research to help us understand a bit more about parent adolescent

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:52.760000 --> 0:00:59.600000]  relationships, so parents and their children between sort of 11 and 15 years old and communication.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:59.600000 --> 0:01:04.480000]  So essentially the study involves you playing an online game today with your mum for eight

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:04.480000 --> 0:01:05.480000]  minutes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:05.480000 --> 0:01:09.360000]  We're going to use Zoom to record a video of you're playing.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:09.360000 --> 0:01:12.200000]  Don't worry, the game doesn't require any gaming skill.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:12.200000 --> 0:01:16.280000]  The rules are very simple and we'll be explained before we start.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:16.280000 --> 0:01:17.600000]  It's designed to be fun.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:17.600000 --> 0:01:18.800000]  I've had a bit of a go myself.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:18.800000 --> 0:01:20.400000]  I think it was, I think it's quite fun.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:20.400000 --> 0:01:23.080000]  So hopefully you will too.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:23.080000 --> 0:01:25.880000]  All of the information, as I said, will be kept safe and secure.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:25.880000 --> 0:01:29.840000]  No one outside of the research team will see your video and the only time you would tell

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:29.840000 --> 0:01:34.560000]  someone is if we are worried about your safety, which I'm sure will not be an issue today.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:34.560000 --> 0:01:36.320000]  So do you have to take part?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:36.320000 --> 0:01:37.880000]  No, it is completely up to you.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:37.880000 --> 0:01:39.280000]  So you can have a chat with your mum now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:39.280000 --> 0:01:41.480000]  You can let me know if you have any questions.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:41.480000 --> 0:01:45.320000]  If you do decide you would like to take part, we can get going with a video.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:45.320000 --> 0:01:47.440000]  If you don't want to take part, you can let me know.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:47.440000 --> 0:01:50.880000]  And also if we start and you feel that you don't want to continue, you can let me know

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:50.880000 --> 0:01:51.880000]  as well.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:51.880000 --> 0:01:54.520000]  So do you feel happy to continue?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:54.520000 --> 0:01:55.520000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:55.520000 --> 0:01:56.520000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:56.520000 --> 0:01:59.520000]  And do you have any sort of questions?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:59.520000 --> 0:02:00.520000]  Ah, no.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:00.520000 --> 0:02:01.520000]  No?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:01.520000 --> 0:02:02.520000]  Perfect.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:02.520000 --> 0:02:05.520000]  So I'll just stop sharing my screen.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:05.520000 --> 0:02:06.520000]  Brilliant.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:06.520000 --> 0:02:13.160000]  So I'm now going to just send a link into the chat, which is the link to the game.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:13.160000 --> 0:02:17.400000]  So if I just pop that in for you, does that come up in the chat?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:17.400000 --> 0:02:18.400000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:18.400000 --> 0:02:22.400000]  So I've clicked it already.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:22.400000 --> 0:02:23.400000]  Mm-hmm.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:23.400000 --> 0:02:24.400000]  Is the game a kiddo?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:24.400000 --> 0:02:26.400000]  Let me just move this so you can see.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:26.400000 --> 0:02:30.720000]  So it should give you the option to choose between keyboard and touch screen so you can

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:30.720000 --> 0:02:32.720000]  choose the one that applies.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:32.720000 --> 0:02:33.720000]  Oh.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:33.720000 --> 0:02:39.760000]  I don't think all my touch screen, well, how, what is keyboard then?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:39.760000 --> 0:02:40.760000]  This one?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:40.760000 --> 0:02:44.640000]  The keyboard is if you've got like, um, the key, you know, like a computer.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:44.640000 --> 0:02:46.960000]  So yeah, feel free to just choose which one.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:46.960000 --> 0:02:48.600000]  I'm not going to keyboard.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:48.600000 --> 0:02:49.600000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:49.600000 --> 0:02:50.600000]  Just be arrows.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:50.600000 --> 0:02:56.600000]  Yeah, it's just sort of two, um, keys, um, and would you be able to share your screen

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:56.600000 --> 0:02:57.600000]  with me?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:57.600000 --> 0:02:58.600000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:58.600000 --> 0:02:59.600000]  Please.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:02:59.600000 --> 0:03:01.600000]  Brilliant.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:01.600000 --> 0:03:06.600000]  Yeah, I can see that.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:06.600000 --> 0:03:09.840000]  So, um, let me just get back on there.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:09.840000 --> 0:03:14.440000]  So I'm not very good with how zoom mirrors it, but essentially, um, Cosmo, you should be

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:14.440000 --> 0:03:20.440000]  on the left, I believe, um, to make it work best for you guys, um, because essentially,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:20.440000 --> 0:03:27.120000]  what is going to happen is, um, Tosha, you're going to draw lines, uh, with the open M keys

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:27.120000 --> 0:03:35.120000]  and then Cosmo is going to do that with the, uh, A and D, whichever way is sort of.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:03:35.120000 --> 0:03:36.120000]  I loved them.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:36.120000 --> 0:03:37.120000]  Right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:37.120000 --> 0:03:39.440000]  Um, so if I just read the instructions, that hopefully it will start to make a little

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:39.440000 --> 0:03:40.440000]  bit of sense.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:40.440000 --> 0:03:41.760000]  So this is edge of sketch.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:41.760000 --> 0:03:43.720000]  Have you ever heard of edge of sketch before?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:44.200000 --> 0:03:51.680000]  No, no, so yeah, so, um, years ago, there used to be a toy, um, called edge of sketch.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:51.680000 --> 0:03:57.400000]  And essentially, it's a drawing toy, um, this is it, but online, it's very similar, um,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:57.400000 --> 0:04:00.400000]  and you should be able to see a picture on the left of the house.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:04:00.400000 --> 0:04:01.400000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:01.400000 --> 0:04:02.400000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:02.400000 --> 0:04:07.280000]  Um, so, um, essentially, we'd like you to copy that onto the edge of sketch by working

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:07.280000 --> 0:04:09]  together, but there are some rules.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:09 --> 0:04:11.080000]  So I'll just let you know those now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:11.080000 --> 0:04:14.960000]  So as I said, Tosha, you can draw lines that are vertical, so up and down by pressing

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:14.960000 --> 0:04:20]  the open M keys, um, and then Cosmo, you can make horizontal lines, go inside by side

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:20 --> 0:04:22.360000]  by pressing the A and D keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:22.360000 --> 0:04:26.640000]  But what is important is that you don't touch each other's keys, so that's the thing

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:26.640000 --> 0:04:27.920000]  to remember there.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:27.920000 --> 0:04:32.600000]  Um, if you think at any point you want to clear it and start over, um, you should be

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:32.600000 --> 0:04:38.520000]  able to see a button new at the top right hand corner there, um, that will sort of

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:38.520000 --> 0:04:42.480000]  light up once you start drawing, you should be able to click that, um, so you can press

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:42.480000 --> 0:04:44.880000]  that at any point, um, throughout the game.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:44.880000 --> 0:04:48.960000]  Um, if you do find that you sort of finish, um, and the time isn't up, then feel free

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:48.960000 --> 0:04:55.200000]  to, um, yeah, do a new one, um, again, um, so you'll be playing for the full eight minutes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:55.200000 --> 0:04:59.880000]  Um, yeah, I will meet myself, and I'll hide my video to avoid any distractions, but I

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:59.880000 --> 0:05:01.200000]  am here if you need anything.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:01.200000 --> 0:05:04.960000]  So, um, yeah, just shout if you have any questions.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:04.960000 --> 0:05:05.960000]  Um, yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:05.960000 --> 0:05:07.960000]  So, does everything sound okay?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:07.960000 --> 0:05:11.400000]  Yes, but we're allowed to talk as long as we don't touch each other's keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:11.400000 --> 0:05:12.400000]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:12.400000 --> 0:05:16.200000]  Yeah, please talk, please, please engage, um, yeah, we each have a work together to try

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:16.200000 --> 0:05:20.880000]  and draw the house, but essentially, yeah, you must stay for your two keys and not touch

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:20.880000 --> 0:05:21.880000]  each other's keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:21.880000 --> 0:05:29.160000]  Um, so I will get my timer set up now, so it'll be for eight minutes, um, yeah, do you

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:29.160000 --> 0:05:35.840000]  have any questions or are you happy to, um, happy to go, yeah, yeah, I will set, um,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:35.840000 --> 0:05:40]  the timer, and I'll turn my camera on microphone off, but yeah, like I said, if you have any

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:40 --> 0:05:41.400000]  questions, just let me know.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:41.400000 --> 0:05:43.400000]  And then I'll come back on after the eight minutes.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:05:43.400000 --> 0:05:44.400000]  Brilliant.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:44.400000 --> 0:05:45.400000]  Let's go.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:05:45.400000 --> 0:05:46.400000]  All right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:46.400000 --> 0:05:48.640000]  How do you want to do it, Bob?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:48.640000 --> 0:05:51.440000]  Uh, I don't really know how to swap.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:51.440000 --> 0:05:52.440000]  So, let's practice.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:52.440000 --> 0:05:53.440000]  Let's see what's going on.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:53.440000 --> 0:05:57.040000]  Well, I'm pressing my keys, but it's actually not moving anything.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:57.040000 --> 0:06:01.080000]  Oh, that's not good.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:01.080000 --> 0:06:06.080000]  Um, was it not, is it not walk in?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:06.080000 --> 0:06:07.080000]  Oh, now it is.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:07.080000 --> 0:06:08.080000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:08.080000 --> 0:06:10.440000]  So there's, there's my line, honey.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:10.440000 --> 0:06:18.720000]  So I've started that, but I could go down, I could also click new, if you want to start

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:18.720000 --> 0:06:19.720000]  to scratch.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:19.720000 --> 0:06:20.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:06:20.720000 --> 0:06:21.720000]  Because you want to center it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:06:21.720000 --> 0:06:22.720000]  Uh, I want to center it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:06:22.720000 --> 0:06:25.720000]  Are you sure you want to erase and create a new sketch?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:25.720000 --> 0:06:26.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:26.720000 --> 0:06:27.720000]  All right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:27.720000 --> 0:06:28.720000]  Let's try that again.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:28.720000 --> 0:06:29.720000]  So.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:06:29.720000 --> 0:06:30.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:06:30.720000 --> 0:06:31.720000]  Wait.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:31.720000 --> 0:06:32.720000]  Let me just.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:32.720000 --> 0:06:33.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:33.720000 --> 0:06:36.720000]  Just letting the pattern.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:06:36.720000 --> 0:06:40.720000]  We're being timed, kiddo, too.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:06:40.720000 --> 0:06:41.720000]  So.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:06:41.720000 --> 0:06:42.720000]  All right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:42.720000 --> 0:06:43.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:43.720000 --> 0:06:45.720000]  So let's see where I'm at again.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:45.720000 --> 0:06:46.720000]  Oh, and M.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:46.720000 --> 0:06:48.720000]  Oh, it sort of starts there.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:48.720000 --> 0:06:50.720000]  But what we can do is.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:50.720000 --> 0:06:52.720000]  I wonder where we'll start.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:52.720000 --> 0:06:54.720000]  You want to just start where it lets us.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:54.720000 --> 0:06:55.720000]  You want to try your keys, huh?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:06.720000 --> 0:07:08.720000]  Which part of the house is that?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:08.720000 --> 0:07:09.720000]  It's probably the ceiling.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:09.720000 --> 0:07:10.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:10.720000 --> 0:07:11.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:11.720000 --> 0:07:12.720000]  So.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:12.720000 --> 0:07:15.720000]  Maybe go a bit left.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:15.720000 --> 0:07:16.720000]  Try.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:07:16.720000 --> 0:07:17.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:20.720000 --> 0:07:21.720000]  That feels about right?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:21.720000 --> 0:07:22.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:22.720000 --> 0:07:23.720000]  Should I have a go?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:24.720000 --> 0:07:25.720000]  And down.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:25.720000 --> 0:07:26.720000]  Oh, oh.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:32.720000 --> 0:07:33.720000]  Well.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:33.720000 --> 0:07:35.720000]  Are we doing a sideways house?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:35.720000 --> 0:07:36.720000]  No, we're not.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:36.720000 --> 0:07:37.720000]  We're copying that house.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:37.720000 --> 0:07:38.720000]  Uh,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:38.720000 --> 0:07:39.720000]  I think let's try and forget.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:39.720000 --> 0:07:41.720000]  We made that mistake there.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:41.720000 --> 0:07:42.720000]  So before.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:42.720000 --> 0:07:43.720000]  So that's what.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:48.720000 --> 0:07:52.720000]  So it's like the lines have to connect.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:52.720000 --> 0:07:53.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:53.720000 --> 0:07:55.720000]  That feels like.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:55.720000 --> 0:07:57.720000]  You're going to do something on the floor.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:57.720000 --> 0:07:59.720000]  Do you want to maybe do.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:59.720000 --> 0:08:00.720000]  The door.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:08:04.720000 --> 0:08:05.720000]  Well.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:05.720000 --> 0:08:07.720000]  Maybe you can go back to the left.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:55.720000 --> 0:08:56.720000]  Good enough.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:56.720000 --> 0:08:57.720000]  Good enough.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:57.720000 --> 0:08:58.720000]  Exactly.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:08:58.720000 --> 0:08:59.720000]  That can be perfect.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:59.720000 --> 0:09:00.720000]  Is it?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:00.720000 --> 0:09:01.720000]  No.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:01.720000 --> 0:09:03.720000]  Because I don't know how we're going to be able to do diagonals.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:03.720000 --> 0:09:04.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:04.720000 --> 0:09:05.720000]  I know.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:14.720000 --> 0:09:16.720000]  It's a little bit wet.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:16.720000 --> 0:09:17.720000]  But.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:17.720000 --> 0:09:18.720000]  Well,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:18.720000 --> 0:09:19.720000]  how about you keep.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:19.720000 --> 0:09:21.720000]  I'm going to try doing diagonals.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:21.720000 --> 0:09:23.720000]  I'm going to try to get to the opposite end.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:23.720000 --> 0:09:27.720000]  And we'll give the roof the actual triangle move ago.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:09:27.720000 --> 0:09:28.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:09:28.720000 --> 0:09:29.720000]  All right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:29.720000 --> 0:09:30.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:30.720000 --> 0:09:31.720000]  Now, do you think it's.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:31.720000 --> 0:09:32.720000]  Oh, wait.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:32.720000 --> 0:09:33.720000]  We can't touch these up other keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:33.720000 --> 0:09:37.720000]  But we can try and do.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:37.720000 --> 0:09:38.720000]  Should we try and do.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:38.720000 --> 0:09:39.720000]  If you do a right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:39.720000 --> 0:09:40.720000]  And I do an up at the same time.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:40.720000 --> 0:09:42.720000]  I think it's going to give us a diagonal.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:42.720000 --> 0:09:43.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:43.720000 --> 0:09:44.720000]  Three.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:09:44.720000 --> 0:09:45.720000]  Two.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:09:45.720000 --> 0:09:46.720000]  One.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:09:46.720000 --> 0:09:47.720000]  Oh.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:47.720000 --> 0:09:49.720000]  That didn't work.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:09:49.720000 --> 0:09:50.720000]  So try that again.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:09:50.720000 --> 0:09:51.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:51.720000 --> 0:09:53.720000]  Maybe, maybe it's a shift.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:53.720000 --> 0:09:55.720000]  No, there are no other keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:55.720000 --> 0:09:56.720000]  I don't think I'm.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:56.720000 --> 0:09:58.720000]  Let's just do steps going on.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:58.720000 --> 0:09:59.720000]  I reckon.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:09:59.720000 --> 0:10:00.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:39.720000 --> 0:10:40.720000]  All right.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:10:40.720000 --> 0:10:41.720000]  Now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:41.720000 --> 0:10:43.720000]  Which elements do you want to head?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:43.720000 --> 0:10:44.720000]  The windows.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:44.720000 --> 0:10:45.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:45.720000 --> 0:10:46.720000]  How was it supposed to do that?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:46.720000 --> 0:10:47.720000]  Well, I'm the down right now, aren't I?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:47.720000 --> 0:10:48.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:48.720000 --> 0:10:51.720000]  So let me go down to where I think the windows can start.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:51.720000 --> 0:10:52.720000]  All right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:52.720000 --> 0:10:55.720000]  I think I'm where the windows can line up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:55.720000 --> 0:10:58.720000]  I think we need you to go to the left.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:58.720000 --> 0:10:59.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:59.720000 --> 0:11:01.720000]  A.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:01.720000 --> 0:11:03.720000]  At least make the crosses.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:03.720000 --> 0:11:04.720000]  Can't we?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:04.720000 --> 0:11:05.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:05.720000 --> 0:11:06.720000]  At least.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:06.720000 --> 0:11:07.720000]  How long?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:07.720000 --> 0:11:08.720000]  I don't know.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:08.720000 --> 0:11:09.720000]  Let's see.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:09.720000 --> 0:11:10.720000]  That first crosses.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:10.720000 --> 0:11:11.720000]  Oh, yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:11.720000 --> 0:11:12.720000]  That looks about right now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:12.720000 --> 0:11:13.720000]  Go back a little bit.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:13.720000 --> 0:11:14.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:14.720000 --> 0:11:16.720000]  Let me do.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:11:16.720000 --> 0:11:17.720000]  D.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:17.720000 --> 0:11:18.720000]  Where it lines.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:18.720000 --> 0:11:19.720000]  Boom.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:19.720000 --> 0:11:22.720000]  Oh, I went down, didn't I?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:22.720000 --> 0:11:25.720000]  I mean, you kind of want to do them both.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:25.720000 --> 0:11:26.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:26.720000 --> 0:11:27.720000]  That's all right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:27.720000 --> 0:11:28.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:28.720000 --> 0:11:29.720000]  Then,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:29.720000 --> 0:11:31.720000]  don't need to go down again.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:31.720000 --> 0:11:32.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:32.720000 --> 0:11:33.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:33.720000 --> 0:11:34.720000]  Let's see where we are.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:11:34.720000 --> 0:11:35.720000]  All right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:35.720000 --> 0:11:36.720000]  Cool.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:36.720000 --> 0:11:37.720000]  How do we do the circle?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:37.720000 --> 0:11:38.720000]  That's just goes in the next house.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:38.720000 --> 0:11:39.720000]  The next window.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:11:39.720000 --> 0:11:40.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:46.720000 --> 0:11:48.720000]  I don't know where I have anymore.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:48.720000 --> 0:11:49.720000]  Just keep.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:49.720000 --> 0:11:50.720000]  Wait.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:51.720000 --> 0:11:52.720000]  Can you press one?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:52.720000 --> 0:11:53.720000]  Sure.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:53.720000 --> 0:11:54.720000]  I thought I lined it up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:54.720000 --> 0:11:55.720000]  Just write those.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:11:55.720000 --> 0:11:56.720000]  Oh.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:11:58.720000 --> 0:11:59.720000]  You see it move.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:11:59.720000 --> 0:12:00.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:12:00.720000 --> 0:12:02.720000]  Then we can just need to go back to the inside.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:12:02.720000 --> 0:12:03.720000]  Oh, I see.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:03.720000 --> 0:12:04.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:04.720000 --> 0:12:05.720000]  You don't have to make up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:05.720000 --> 0:12:06.720000]  You don't have to cross.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:06.720000 --> 0:12:07.720000]  Across the house.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:07.720000 --> 0:12:08.720000]  Do you?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:08.720000 --> 0:12:09.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:09.720000 --> 0:12:10.720000]  Hold up.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:12:15.720000 --> 0:12:17.720000]  You can teach it that line.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:12:17.720000 --> 0:12:18.720000]  Mm-hmm.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:12:18.720000 --> 0:12:19.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:19.720000 --> 0:12:20.720000]  Is it my turn?

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:12:34.720000 --> 0:12:35.720000]  Nice.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:35.720000 --> 0:12:36.720000]  Nice balance.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:36.720000 --> 0:12:39.720000]  And I think I need you to go back to where you want me to do the right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:39.720000 --> 0:12:40.720000]  Yes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:12:40.720000 --> 0:12:41.720000]  I'm going to.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:12:41.720000 --> 0:12:42.720000]  I'm going to make it the same.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:12:42.720000 --> 0:12:43.720000]  Sure.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:12:43.720000 --> 0:12:44.720000]  So.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:44.720000 --> 0:12:46.720000]  So it will be wonky again.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:46.720000 --> 0:12:47.720000]  That's fine.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:47.720000 --> 0:12:48.720000]  Is it that?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:48.720000 --> 0:12:49.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:49.720000 --> 0:12:50.720000]  Looks like it actually.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:50.720000 --> 0:12:51.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:51.720000 --> 0:12:52.720000]  Oh.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:52.720000 --> 0:12:53.720000]  Boom.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:53.720000 --> 0:12:55.720000]  So let's make it the same two.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:12:59.720000 --> 0:13:00.720000]  And then.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:13:00.720000 --> 0:13:02.720000]  Down.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:13:02.720000 --> 0:13:03.720000]  All right.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:13:03.720000 --> 0:13:04.720000]  Cool.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:13:04.720000 --> 0:13:05.720000]  Now what?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:05.720000 --> 0:13:07.720000]  Oh, I forgot to do the chimney.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:07.720000 --> 0:13:08.720000]  Oh, yes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:08.720000 --> 0:13:09.720000]  Oh, yes.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:15.720000 --> 0:13:16.720000]  All right.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:13:16.720000 --> 0:13:18.720000]  Do you want me to get up there, though?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:18.720000 --> 0:13:19.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:19.720000 --> 0:13:22.720000]  Are you sure you want to go back a little bit?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:22.720000 --> 0:13:23.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:23.720000 --> 0:13:25.720000]  Are you sure?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:25.720000 --> 0:13:27.720000]  Oh, no, no.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:27.720000 --> 0:13:28.720000]  Are you okay?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:28.720000 --> 0:13:29.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:29.720000 --> 0:13:30.720000]  It's good.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:30.720000 --> 0:13:31.720000]  This is the last.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:31.720000 --> 0:13:32.720000]  I can do.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:32.720000 --> 0:13:35.720000]  Oh, do we have to do the stairs to go back up there?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:35.720000 --> 0:13:36.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:36.720000 --> 0:13:37.720000]  Really?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:37.720000 --> 0:13:38.720000]  Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:38.720000 --> 0:13:39.720000]  Everything's wrong.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:39.720000 --> 0:13:40.720000]  Where do you anyways?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:40.720000 --> 0:13:41.720000]  Well, I'll just cut across.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:41.720000 --> 0:13:42.720000]  Let's cut across and make chimney.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:42.720000 --> 0:13:43.720000]  Come on.

[Speaker UNKNOWN] [0:13:43.720000 --> 0:13:44.720000]  Come on.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:44.720000 --> 0:13:45.720000]  Come on and dance.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:45.720000 --> 0:13:46.720000]  You're in charge of it.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:46.720000 --> 0:13:47.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:47.720000 --> 0:13:48.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:48.720000 --> 0:13:49.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:50.720000 --> 0:13:51.720000]  D.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:13:51.720000 --> 0:13:52.720000]  Hi, guys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:13:52.720000 --> 0:13:53.720000]  I'm really sorry.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:13:53.720000 --> 0:13:54.720000]  I'm going to come back in there.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:13:54.720000 --> 0:13:55.720000]  That is the eight.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:13:55.720000 --> 0:13:56.720000]  Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:13:56.720000 --> 0:13:58.720000]  How did you find that?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:13:58.720000 --> 0:14:02.720000]  Hard because you do not do diagonal lines all make over.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:14:02.720000 --> 0:14:04.720000]  It is quite tricky, isn't it?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:14:04.720000 --> 0:14:06.720000]  I'm just going to stop the recording now.
