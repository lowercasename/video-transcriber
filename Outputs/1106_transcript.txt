[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:00 --> 0:00:07.760000]  Gordon, no. Perfect. It's like a robot, doesn't it? Right, Celia, I don't know how much

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:07.760000 --> 0:00:12.720000]  she- I'm just told you about the study, but I've got a bit of information now to sort of talk

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:12.720000 --> 0:00:17.600000]  you through and then you can let me know if you want to proceed with the game. So I'm going to

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:17.600000 --> 0:00:27.760000]  share my screen to just get the information here it is. So can you see it there? Yeah, so I'll

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:27.760000 --> 0:00:32.720000]  read for it as well, but I know some people prefer to see it visually as well as here. So essentially,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:32.720000 --> 0:00:38.080000]  I go to a university in London and part of a team where we're looking into testing a new game

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:38.080000 --> 0:00:44.720000]  that aims to help us understand parent and adolescence, so teenage relationships and communication.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:45.680000 --> 0:00:50.720000]  So the study involves playing an online game today with your mum for eight minutes. We're going to

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:50.720000 --> 0:00:57.120000]  use Zoom to record the video as we do it now. The game doesn't require any sort of gaming skill.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:00:57.200000 --> 0:01:01.200000]  The rules are very simple and I would explain them to you once we go ahead with the game.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:02.160000 --> 0:01:07.440000]  In terms of your information, that will be kept, like I said, safe and secure, only the research team

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:07.440000 --> 0:01:12.080000]  will see it. In terms of taking part, it's completely up to you. If you've got any questions,

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:12.080000 --> 0:01:16.720000]  you can let me know. If you don't want to take part, you can also let me know, or if you sort of start

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:16.720000 --> 0:01:22.320000]  and then half way through, change your mind, you can also stop them too. So that's sort of the

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:22.320000 --> 0:01:30.160000]  information. Do you have any questions? Are you happy to go ahead? Yeah, perfect. Thank you. So

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:30.160000 --> 0:01:35.920000]  I'll just stop sharing my screen now. And I'm just now going to put the link to the game in the chat.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:37.440000 --> 0:01:47.280000]  Two sex, I'll just paste that in. So if you could open that up and you should think an option to

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:47.280000 --> 0:01:53.360000]  either for keyboard or touch screen, obviously choose the one that's great pickable to you.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:01:53.360000 --> 0:01:58.720000]  Yeah, we're in. We're on the keyboard. And then you're able to share your screen again, please.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:01:58.720000 --> 0:02:10.720000]  I'm trying. You can tell like, oh, yeah, we go.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:13.600000 --> 0:02:22.720000]  Yeah, perfect. Yeah, great. So you should see on the left hand side, there's the picture of the house.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:23.440000 --> 0:02:28.400000]  Yes. Yes. So this is the edge sketch online. So you have you seen an edge sketch before?

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:29.600000 --> 0:02:36.720000]  Yes. Yeah, yeah. So it's basically that. I think really, really rubbish one.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:37.520000 --> 0:02:44.320000]  This was basically the hubble when I was younger. 35 years ago. Yeah. Yeah, it's exactly the same as

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:44.320000 --> 0:02:49.600000]  the physical one, but just online. And as I said, there's the picture on the side that we're going

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:49.600000 --> 0:02:56.160000]  to want you to replicate onto the drawing pad for getting to call it. So there are some rules

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:02:56.160000 --> 0:03:02.480000]  also to the game. So Liz, you can only draw on the lines that are vertical. So up and down by pressing

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:02.480000 --> 0:03:09.120000]  the open end keys. And then you can only make horizontal lines. So go inside by side by pressing the

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:09.120000 --> 0:03:14.320000]  A and D keys. So you might need to swap. I'm not sure which side you, I think we're actually on the right

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:14.320000 --> 0:03:19.200000]  side. You're on the right side. Oh, perfect. Yeah. So and the most important thing though is that

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:19.200000 --> 0:03:23.440000]  you're not allowed to touch each other's keys. Okay. So you've got to stick with your keys.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:24.400000 --> 0:03:29.600000]  If you want to at any point start again, there's a button at the top right. You can see it. I

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:29.600000 --> 0:03:35.040000]  think that says new. So once you start drawing that will become clickable. So you can restart at any

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:35.040000 --> 0:03:39.920000]  point you need to. You'll have eight minutes to copy the image together. I'm going to meet myself

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:39.920000 --> 0:03:44.720000]  and like hide my video. So I hopefully won't be distracted, but I'm here if you need anything.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:45.360000 --> 0:03:50.320000]  If you are finished before the time is up, then just start again. We just essentially want you

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:50.320000 --> 0:03:55.200000]  to be playing for the full eight minutes. And then I will speak to you to tell you like when

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:03:55.200000 --> 0:04:02]  the time is up. Sure. But yeah, does that all sort of make sense? Yeah. Yeah, we're ready.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:04:02 --> 0:04:07.200000]  Okay, I will get the you ready to go. I'll get the timer up and I'll turn my audio and video off

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:04:07.200000 --> 0:04:15.680000]  and then you guys are good to go. Okay. Ready, go. Do you want, I don't, do you go for it? Oh look,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:04:15.680000 --> 0:04:22.080000]  okay. So we're in the middle. So should we do the door? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:24.640000 --> 0:04:25.120000]  Nice.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:28.720000 --> 0:04:32]  All right. Good. I go. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:34.720000 --> 0:04:36.320000]  Wait, should you want to go back up?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:38.320000 --> 0:04:44.080000]  You can go back. Go back left. Press A. Wait. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you can see where you are. Yeah,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:04:44.080000 --> 0:04:52.960000]  okay. So do you think about there? Yeah, go up, go up, go up, go up. Hey, that's not bad.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:04:52.960000 --> 0:04:56.800000]  That's not bad. That's not too bad. Do you want to go back? No, I'm going back down.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:04:59.360000 --> 0:05:07.360000]  Okay. Wait. Oh, we're doing it on the line. Okay. How far? I think we need to go quite far

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:07.360000 --> 0:05:12.480000]  because we've got to a circle apparently in a minute. I don't know how that works. Yeah. So,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:12.480000 --> 0:05:16.720000]  you know, give us plenty of room. Like that. Yeah, we can. Do you think? Go up. Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:05:20.560000 --> 0:05:24.560000]  So it's going to be quite high. Yeah, but we've got to get a roof. Yeah, I'll go. I'll go. Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:05:25.920000 --> 0:05:30.960000]  I'm just going to do a big line. Let me try and make it symmetrical. Love me. I love that.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:30.960000 --> 0:05:34.240000]  We think about like this. Yeah, that's good. Thank you. That was beautiful.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:05:36.160000 --> 0:05:42.160000]  Okay. Oh, oh, oh, wait. Do you think I went too far? Oh, wait. I can't go up. You go,

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:05:42.240000 --> 0:05:50.240000]  are you up? Go. Oh, that was great. Okay. Should we try and do the roof?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:50.880000 --> 0:05:53.840000]  Yeah. So we need to go across. Can you see?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:05:58.320000 --> 0:06:05.680000]  There you go. Okay. Right. How do we do a diagonal? I think we need to do sort of both at once

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:05.680000 --> 0:06:12.800000]  a little bit. So if I hold down A and you hold down A. What's going to happen? Should we do a

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:06:12.800000 --> 0:06:21.440000]  little bit? Three, two, one, go. No, it can't stop because you. Sorry, I stopped. I know. I know,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:21.440000 --> 0:06:25.680000]  I know. That was my first. It's really good, though. We could just give going. Oh, no,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:25.680000 --> 0:06:31.040000]  but we're not going to fit the whole thing in. Look. I think it's going to be nice. It's

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:06:31.040000 --> 0:06:40.080000]  meant to be like that then. I think we could make it look nice. I mean, that's not the house,

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:06:40.080000 --> 0:06:49.760000]  though. Then we go down. Okay. One, two, three, go. Okay. Wait. No, that's not the house. There we go.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:06:49.760000 --> 0:07:00.480000]  Oh, God. Oh, I can't go up. You got to go up. I think. Again, no, we have to do it again. No.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:00.480000 --> 0:07:04.880000]  Where are you from going? We need to do the eye. I think we should start again, but

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:04.880000 --> 0:07:13.360000]  start further down. Should we start again? Yeah. Do you agree? Okay. Right. Okay. Right. That's okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:13.360000 --> 0:07:19.360000]  Where do we start again? In the middle. Oh, why do we start that? Maybe because that's where we

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:19.360000 --> 0:07:28.480000]  finished. So do we? Oh, yeah. Yes. You're genius. Yes. Yeah. So let's start your genius. Right.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:29.280000 --> 0:07:35.200000]  So go that way a bit more. Like that? Yeah. Perfect. Are we ready? Yeah.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:40.400000 --> 0:07:46.160000]  Wait. Yes. I was pressing the wrong button. Yes. Yeah. Oh, this is this is so good. Right. So should I,

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:46.160000 --> 0:07:54.720000]  I might just go across the number? No. Okay. Don't click anything. Can I go up now?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:07:55.600000 --> 0:07:59.920000]  Wait, we need to do the door. No, we couldn't come back to the way. Let's try and get that.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:07:59.920000 --> 0:08:04.880000]  If I think the roof is a painful bit. So we should make it not as, oh, no, but now we've made it

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:08:04.880000 --> 0:08:14.320000]  really wide. It's fine. The house can be wide. Okay. It's a bundle of. Okay. A and O, three, two, one.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:08:14.320000 --> 0:08:26.640000]  Oh, big. Wait, should we start at the roof? Oh, do you think we should start at the roof? Wait,

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:08:26.640000 --> 0:08:30.560000]  let's start at like a point. Let's start in the middle. Yeah. At the middle point.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:08:32.240000 --> 0:08:35.360000]  Oh, what the heck are you doing? Starting in the middle. Start there. Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:38.400000 --> 0:08:43.600000]  Imagine if it might already be eight minutes. Right. So are we doing, which side are we doing?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:08:43.600000 --> 0:08:49.680000]  We're doing you directors. We'll do this way. Okay. So that's. And three, two, one. Stop.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:08:50.560000 --> 0:08:54.400000]  Okay. Why is it? Okay. Let's just make our house small. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So now,

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:10:43.040000 --> 0:10:44.480000]  sometimes going across the picture.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:47.280000 --> 0:10:48.720000]  Should we make a really wide goal?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:51.760000 --> 0:10:53.680000]  From here. Make it a little wide like. Okay.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:10:53.680000 --> 0:10:58.400000]  Okay. Go, go, go.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:11:05.600000 --> 0:11:10.240000]  We didn't make a house here in a barn. We need some smoke and then some coal.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:11:10.240000 --> 0:11:15.600000]  No, go to the corner. Where are we? Oh, I can't go up and down.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:46.880000 --> 0:11:50]  But we need to not just hold it down because it'll just make a straight line.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:11:50 --> 0:11:53.280000]  I think, I think, I think we might need to, yeah, do a bit of taffy tap.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:11:53.280000 --> 0:11:54.480000]  Okay. Go on, give.

[Speaker SPEAKER_00] [0:12:21.040000 --> 0:12:23.600000]  So, I'm going to stop the recording now.
