 Gordon; no. Perfect. It's like a robot; doesn't it? Right; Celia; I don't know how much,SPEAKER_00,0:00:00,0:00:07.760000
 she- I'm just told you about the study; but I've got a bit of information now to sort of talk,SPEAKER_00,0:00:07.760000,0:00:12.720000
 you through and then you can let me know if you want to proceed with the game. So I'm going to,SPEAKER_00,0:00:12.720000,0:00:17.600000
 share my screen to just get the information here it is. So can you see it there? Yeah; so I'll,SPEAKER_00,0:00:17.600000,0:00:27.760000
 read for it as well; but I know some people prefer to see it visually as well as here. So essentially;,SPEAKER_00,0:00:27.760000,0:00:32.720000
 I go to a university in London and part of a team where we're looking into testing a new game,SPEAKER_00,0:00:32.720000,0:00:38.080000
 that aims to help us understand parent and adolescence; so teenage relationships and communication.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:38.080000,0:00:44.720000
 So the study involves playing an online game today with your mum for eight minutes. We're going to,SPEAKER_00,0:00:45.680000,0:00:50.720000
 use Zoom to record the video as we do it now. The game doesn't require any sort of gaming skill.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:50.720000,0:00:57.120000
 The rules are very simple and I would explain them to you once we go ahead with the game.,SPEAKER_00,0:00:57.200000,0:01:01.200000
 In terms of your information; that will be kept; like I said; safe and secure; only the research team,SPEAKER_00,0:01:02.160000,0:01:07.440000
 will see it. In terms of taking part; it's completely up to you. If you've got any questions;,SPEAKER_00,0:01:07.440000,0:01:12.080000
 you can let me know. If you don't want to take part; you can also let me know; or if you sort of start,SPEAKER_00,0:01:12.080000,0:01:16.720000
 and then half way through; change your mind; you can also stop them too. So that's sort of the,SPEAKER_00,0:01:16.720000,0:01:22.320000
 information. Do you have any questions? Are you happy to go ahead? Yeah; perfect. Thank you. So,SPEAKER_00,0:01:22.320000,0:01:30.160000
 I'll just stop sharing my screen now. And I'm just now going to put the link to the game in the chat.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:30.160000,0:01:35.920000
 Two sex; I'll just paste that in. So if you could open that up and you should think an option to,SPEAKER_00,0:01:37.440000,0:01:47.280000
 either for keyboard or touch screen; obviously choose the one that's great pickable to you.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:47.280000,0:01:53.360000
 Yeah; we're in. We're on the keyboard. And then you're able to share your screen again; please.,SPEAKER_00,0:01:53.360000,0:01:58.720000
 I'm trying. You can tell like; oh; yeah; we go.,SPEAKER_01,0:01:58.720000,0:02:10.720000
 Yeah; perfect. Yeah; great. So you should see on the left hand side; there's the picture of the house.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:13.600000,0:02:22.720000
 Yes. Yes. So this is the edge sketch online. So you have you seen an edge sketch before?,SPEAKER_01,0:02:23.440000,0:02:28.400000
 Yes. Yeah; yeah. So it's basically that. I think really; really rubbish one.,SPEAKER_00,0:02:29.600000,0:02:36.720000
 This was basically the hubble when I was younger. 35 years ago. Yeah. Yeah; it's exactly the same as,SPEAKER_01,0:02:37.520000,0:02:44.320000
 the physical one; but just online. And as I said; there's the picture on the side that we're going,SPEAKER_00,0:02:44.320000,0:02:49.600000
 to want you to replicate onto the drawing pad for getting to call it. So there are some rules,SPEAKER_00,0:02:49.600000,0:02:56.160000
 also to the game. So Liz; you can only draw on the lines that are vertical. So up and down by pressing,SPEAKER_00,0:02:56.160000,0:03:02.480000
 the open end keys. And then you can only make horizontal lines. So go inside by side by pressing the,SPEAKER_00,0:03:02.480000,0:03:09.120000
 A and D keys. So you might need to swap. I'm not sure which side you; I think we're actually on the right,SPEAKER_00,0:03:09.120000,0:03:14.320000
 side. You're on the right side. Oh; perfect. Yeah. So and the most important thing though is that,SPEAKER_00,0:03:14.320000,0:03:19.200000
 you're not allowed to touch each other's keys. Okay. So you've got to stick with your keys.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:19.200000,0:03:23.440000
 If you want to at any point start again; there's a button at the top right. You can see it. I,SPEAKER_00,0:03:24.400000,0:03:29.600000
 think that says new. So once you start drawing that will become clickable. So you can restart at any,SPEAKER_00,0:03:29.600000,0:03:35.040000
 point you need to. You'll have eight minutes to copy the image together. I'm going to meet myself,SPEAKER_00,0:03:35.040000,0:03:39.920000
 and like hide my video. So I hopefully won't be distracted; but I'm here if you need anything.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:39.920000,0:03:44.720000
 If you are finished before the time is up; then just start again. We just essentially want you,SPEAKER_00,0:03:45.360000,0:03:50.320000
 to be playing for the full eight minutes. And then I will speak to you to tell you like when,SPEAKER_00,0:03:50.320000,0:03:55.200000
 the time is up. Sure. But yeah; does that all sort of make sense? Yeah. Yeah; we're ready.,SPEAKER_00,0:03:55.200000,0:04:02
 Okay; I will get the you ready to go. I'll get the timer up and I'll turn my audio and video off,SPEAKER_01,0:04:02,0:04:07.200000
 and then you guys are good to go. Okay. Ready; go. Do you want; I don't; do you go for it? Oh look;,SPEAKER_00,0:04:07.200000,0:04:15.680000
 okay. So we're in the middle. So should we do the door? Oh; yeah; yeah; yeah; yeah. Yeah; yeah; yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:04:15.680000,0:04:22.080000
 Nice.,SPEAKER_02,0:04:24.640000,0:04:25.120000
 All right. Good. I go. Oh; yeah; yeah; yeah; yeah.,SPEAKER_02,0:04:28.720000,0:04:32
 Wait; should you want to go back up?,SPEAKER_02,0:04:34.720000,0:04:36.320000
 You can go back. Go back left. Press A. Wait. Yeah; yeah; yeah; yeah; you can see where you are. Yeah;,SPEAKER_02,0:04:38.320000,0:04:44.080000
 okay. So do you think about there? Yeah; go up; go up; go up; go up. Hey; that's not bad.,SPEAKER_01,0:04:44.080000,0:04:52.960000
 That's not bad. That's not too bad. Do you want to go back? No; I'm going back down.,SPEAKER_01,0:04:52.960000,0:04:56.800000
 Okay. Wait. Oh; we're doing it on the line. Okay. How far? I think we need to go quite far,SPEAKER_01,0:04:59.360000,0:05:07.360000
 because we've got to a circle apparently in a minute. I don't know how that works. Yeah. So;,SPEAKER_01,0:05:07.360000,0:05:12.480000
 you know; give us plenty of room. Like that. Yeah; we can. Do you think? Go up. Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:12.480000,0:05:16.720000
 So it's going to be quite high. Yeah; but we've got to get a roof. Yeah; I'll go. I'll go. Yeah.,SPEAKER_02,0:05:20.560000,0:05:24.560000
 I'm just going to do a big line. Let me try and make it symmetrical. Love me. I love that.,SPEAKER_02,0:05:25.920000,0:05:30.960000
 We think about like this. Yeah; that's good. Thank you. That was beautiful.,SPEAKER_01,0:05:30.960000,0:05:34.240000
 Okay. Oh; oh; oh; wait. Do you think I went too far? Oh; wait. I can't go up. You go;,SPEAKER_02,0:05:36.160000,0:05:42.160000
 are you up? Go. Oh; that was great. Okay. Should we try and do the roof?,SPEAKER_02,0:05:42.240000,0:05:50.240000
 Yeah. So we need to go across. Can you see?,SPEAKER_01,0:05:50.880000,0:05:53.840000
 There you go. Okay. Right. How do we do a diagonal? I think we need to do sort of both at once,SPEAKER_01,0:05:58.320000,0:06:05.680000
 a little bit. So if I hold down A and you hold down A. What's going to happen? Should we do a,SPEAKER_01,0:06:05.680000,0:06:12.800000
 little bit? Three; two; one; go. No; it can't stop because you. Sorry; I stopped. I know. I know;,SPEAKER_02,0:06:12.800000,0:06:21.440000
 I know. That was my first. It's really good; though. We could just give going. Oh; no;,SPEAKER_01,0:06:21.440000,0:06:25.680000
 but we're not going to fit the whole thing in. Look. I think it's going to be nice. It's,SPEAKER_01,0:06:25.680000,0:06:31.040000
 meant to be like that then. I think we could make it look nice. I mean; that's not the house;,SPEAKER_01,0:06:31.040000,0:06:40.080000
 though. Then we go down. Okay. One; two; three; go. Okay. Wait. No; that's not the house. There we go.,SPEAKER_02,0:06:40.080000,0:06:49.760000
 Oh; God. Oh; I can't go up. You got to go up. I think. Again; no; we have to do it again. No.,SPEAKER_02,0:06:49.760000,0:07:00.480000
 Where are you from going? We need to do the eye. I think we should start again; but,SPEAKER_01,0:07:00.480000,0:07:04.880000
 start further down. Should we start again? Yeah. Do you agree? Okay. Right. Okay. Right. That's okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:04.880000,0:07:13.360000
 Where do we start again? In the middle. Oh; why do we start that? Maybe because that's where we,SPEAKER_01,0:07:13.360000,0:07:19.360000
 finished. So do we? Oh; yeah. Yes. You're genius. Yes. Yeah. So let's start your genius. Right.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:19.360000,0:07:28.480000
 So go that way a bit more. Like that? Yeah. Perfect. Are we ready? Yeah.,SPEAKER_01,0:07:29.280000,0:07:35.200000
 Wait. Yes. I was pressing the wrong button. Yes. Yeah. Oh; this is this is so good. Right. So should I;,SPEAKER_02,0:07:40.400000,0:07:46.160000
 I might just go across the number? No. Okay. Don't click anything. Can I go up now?,SPEAKER_02,0:07:46.160000,0:07:54.720000
 Wait; we need to do the door. No; we couldn't come back to the way. Let's try and get that.,SPEAKER_02,0:07:55.600000,0:07:59.920000
 If I think the roof is a painful bit. So we should make it not as; oh; no; but now we've made it,SPEAKER_01,0:07:59.920000,0:08:04.880000
 really wide. It's fine. The house can be wide. Okay. It's a bundle of. Okay. A and O; three; two; one.,SPEAKER_02,0:08:04.880000,0:08:14.320000
 Oh; big. Wait; should we start at the roof? Oh; do you think we should start at the roof? Wait;,SPEAKER_02,0:08:14.320000,0:08:26.640000
 let's start at like a point. Let's start in the middle. Yeah. At the middle point.,SPEAKER_02,0:08:26.640000,0:08:30.560000
 Oh; what the heck are you doing? Starting in the middle. Start there. Okay.,SPEAKER_02,0:08:32.240000,0:08:35.360000
 Imagine if it might already be eight minutes. Right. So are we doing; which side are we doing?,SPEAKER_01,0:08:38.400000,0:08:43.600000
 We're doing you directors. We'll do this way. Okay. So that's. And three; two; one. Stop.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:43.600000,0:08:49.680000
 Okay. Why is it? Okay. Let's just make our house small. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So now;,SPEAKER_02,0:08:50.560000,0:08:54.400000
 go; go that way. Right. Stop. Okay. And then O and D.,SPEAKER_01,0:08:56,0:09:04.560000
 A. I have to go left. Oh; yes. You're right. Three; two; one. Please.,SPEAKER_02,0:09:06.160000,0:09:10.240000
 That's pretty good. That's pretty good. So good. Right. Go down. Go down one.,SPEAKER_02,0:09:11.040000,0:09:14.640000
 Yeah. Now we need to. Oh; my goodness. Now we have to get back down. Okay. Right.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:16.720000,0:09:22

 Oh; that's not bad. You know; that's not bad. And then go try to get that way.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:27.360000,0:09:30.640000
 Oops. Wait. Oh; sorry.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:33.200000,0:09:35.200000
 Oops. Oops. Now from here.,SPEAKER_02,0:09:35.360000,0:09:38.960000
 Okay. Should we do the door? No. No; we're not going the door.,SPEAKER_01,0:09:41.680000,0:09:48.320000
 Go up.,SPEAKER_02,0:09:49.120000,0:09:49.600000

 Wait. Let's do like one click at a time. Yeah. And we're only going to do a little bit.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:04.880000,0:10:07.840000
 Okay. One. Well; let's hold it down just for a second. Okay. One; two; three; go.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:07.840000,0:10:12.320000
 And then I'm going to go up. Yes. I'll go across.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:13.520000,0:10:18
 Why do you have a rounded chimney? Okay. Hold on. Right. Okay. And then,SPEAKER_02,0:10:21.440000,0:10:26.640000
 down M and D just for a little bit. One; two; three; go.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:27.440000,0:10:30.480000
 Okay. Okay. Should we do go down? Let's see the door. Wait. How do we do the circle?,SPEAKER_01,0:10:31.440000,0:10:38.960000
 Yeah. I think we're; I don't; I mean; they're just; etches get you. She have to have lines,SPEAKER_01,0:10:38.960000,0:10:43.040000
 sometimes going across the picture.,SPEAKER_01,0:10:43.040000,0:10:44.480000
 Should we make a really wide goal?,SPEAKER_02,0:10:47.280000,0:10:48.720000
 From here. Make it a little wide like. Okay.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:51.760000,0:10:53.680000
 Okay. Go; go; go.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:53.680000,0:10:58.400000
 You're such a sabotage. Right. Right. Okay. It's like a barn. Yeah.,SPEAKER_02,0:10:58.400000,0:11:04.240000
 We didn't make a house here in a barn. We need some smoke and then some coal.,SPEAKER_02,0:11:05.600000,0:11:10.240000
 No; go to the corner. Where are we? Oh; I can't go up and down.,SPEAKER_02,0:11:10.240000,0:11:15.600000
 There you go. Nice. Nice. Okay. Now.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:16.400000,0:11:21.200000
 I've no idea how we're meant to do this. I think;,SPEAKER_01,0:11:23.840000,0:11:27.120000
 how do you think we do this? Oh; yeah. Yeah. So;,SPEAKER_01,0:11:30.480000,0:11:32.880000
 what; what are you thinking? I can't go up. I can't go up. Why do I need to go up?,SPEAKER_01,0:11:34.880000,0:11:38.080000
 One; two; three. Okay.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:38.240000,0:11:40.160000
 From here. So; I'm going to go D and you're going to go. Okay.,SPEAKER_02,0:11:44.160000,0:11:46.880000
 But we need to not just hold it down because it'll just make a straight line.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:46.880000,0:11:50
 I think; I think; I think we might need to; yeah; do a bit of taffy tap.,SPEAKER_02,0:11:50,0:11:53.280000
 Okay. Go on; give.,SPEAKER_01,0:11:53.280000,0:11:54.480000

 Oh my. Wait. And now; and now we go the other way. Okay. Go; go; go.,SPEAKER_02,0:12:02.400000,0:12:07.360000
 Which way? Wait; wait; wait. Do you mean down? Yeah. Okay. Go.,SPEAKER_02,0:12:07.360000,0:12:12.400000
 I'm collecting the wrong button. Okay. That is your time up.,SPEAKER_02,0:12:14.320000,0:12:18.240000
 So; I'm going to stop the recording now.,SPEAKER_00,0:12:21.040000,0:12:23.600000
