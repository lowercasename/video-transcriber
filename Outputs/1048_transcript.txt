[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:00 --> 0:00:09.120000]  Okay, that should now be recording, perfect. So Elizabeth, I don't know how much your mum has

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:09.120000 --> 0:00:13.600000]  like told you about the study but I'm going to tell you a bit about it now and you can let me know

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:13.600000 --> 0:00:18.400000]  if you have any questions and then let me know if you want to like continue with the game. So

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:18.400000 --> 0:00:26.080000]  I'm going to share my screen, give me two seconds just to show you what I'm reading out.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:26.080000 --> 0:00:33.200000]  Where is it? Here we go. So I'm going to read it out but it's also there if you want to read it as

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:33.200000 --> 0:00:39.760000]  well but essentially I go to University in London and I'm part of a team looking into testing this

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:39.760000 --> 0:00:45.520000]  new game that aims to help us understand parent and like teenager or you know just under teenager

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:45.520000 --> 0:00:51.520000]  adolescent relationships and communication. So in terms of your like involvement in the study

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:51.600000 --> 0:00:55.920000]  you're playing an online game today with your mum for eight minutes. We're going to use you to

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:00:55.920000 --> 0:01:00.800000]  record the video if you're playing. It doesn't require like any gaming skill and I'll give you like

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:01:00.800000 --> 0:01:06.720000]  the instructions before you get started. The rules are sort of very simple. In terms of the information

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:01:06.720000 --> 0:01:11.920000]  you give us so the video like I said that will be kept safe and secure and only me and sort of the

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:01:11.920000 --> 0:01:17.280000]  other researchers in the team will see that. You don't have to take part like I said yeah it's not

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:01:17.760000 --> 0:01:22.080000]  poultry and yeah if you've got any questions you can let me know. If you do want to take part

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:01:22.080000 --> 0:01:27.040000]  you can let me know now and then we can get started. Yeah that's it really. Do you have any?

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:01:27.040000 --> 0:01:32.800000]  We want to take part don't we? Yeah. Yeah you're okay. Perfect. I'll just stop sharing my screen now

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:01:32.800000 --> 0:01:40.800000]  and I'm going to put in the chat a link to the game. So give me two seconds.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:01:40.960000 --> 0:01:49.520000]  I'll copy that into the chat so that should be there now if you can open that

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:01:53.360000 --> 0:02:00.240000]  I'll click it. Is it? Yeah. Yeah does that open and they should get the option to either do

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:02:00.240000 --> 0:02:05.280000]  keyboard or touch screen depending on whether we haven't got a touch screen. Okay so keyboard.

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:02:06.720000 --> 0:02:09.360000]  Perfect. Does that all come up okay?

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:10.800000 --> 0:02:24.560000]  Yeah and able to share your screen. Are we sharing? No wait. Minimize this then go down and share.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:02:27.840000 --> 0:02:36.640000]  Yeah. Yeah. Oh how did you do that? Perfect. There we go. Yeah brilliant. So and then it is

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:02:36.640000 --> 0:02:41.840000]  before you sat on the left. Yeah. Yep. That's right. She's on my right. Oh so you

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:02:41.840000 --> 0:02:45.360000]  so I think it's to be easier for Elizabeth on the left and then Joe you're on the right just for the

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:02:48.960000 --> 0:02:59.680000]  little bit of a change. Musical chairs. Perfect. Yep that's good brilliant. So you should be able to

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:02:59.680000 --> 0:03:05.200000]  see the edge sketch in front of you. Have you guys seen an edge sketch before? Yeah. Yes it's basically

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:05.200000 --> 0:03:10.880000]  the same as like the physical one but online and you should be able to see the picture on the left

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:10.880000 --> 0:03:17.680000]  hand side. Yeah yeah so that's what we'd like you to copy onto the edge sketch by working together

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:17.680000 --> 0:03:22.720000]  but there is like a few rules which I'll talk you through now. So Joe you can only draw lines that

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:22.720000 --> 0:03:28.720000]  are vertical so up and down by pressing the O and M keys and then Elizabeth you can only make

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:28.720000 --> 0:03:34.800000]  horizontal lines so go inside by side by pressing the A and D keys and but the most important

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:34.800000 --> 0:03:39.680000]  thing to remember is you're not allowed to touch each other each other's keys and you must stick

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:39.680000 --> 0:03:43.920000]  to your keys and if you want to at any point start again there is a button you should be able to

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:43.920000 --> 0:03:49.280000]  see at the top that says new and once you start sort of drawing it will become clickable and that

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:49.280000 --> 0:03:58.560000]  will sort of reset it and you can start again. If you like finish sort of before the time is up

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:03:58.560000 --> 0:04:02.240000]  if you can just like start again we basically just want you to be playing for the whole

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:02.320000 --> 0:04:09.680000]  eight minutes if possible. I will put a timer on and I will mute myself and turn my camera off

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:09.680000 --> 0:04:14.400000]  so I won't like distract you and I'll come back on after the eight minutes but I'm still here

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:14.400000 --> 0:04:20.080000]  like if you need anything or you've got any issues and yeah I think that's it really does that

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:20.080000 --> 0:04:29.120000]  all make sense? Yeah yeah perfect so I'll get my timer up and so it's going to be eight minutes

[Speaker SPEAKER_02] [0:04:30 --> 0:04:36.080000]  and yeah are you guys ready to get started? Yeah yeah perfect I'll start it from now.

[Speaker SPEAKER_01] [0:04:41.680000 --> 0:04:48.960000]  Now I'll go down and do the door should I? Okay do you want to go that way?
