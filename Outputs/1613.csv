More into language.,Adam Sayer,00:00:01.690,00:00:03.179
"Yeah, you should have had a robot voice tell you that it started recording.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:00:03.180,00:00:07.779
"So, Amelia, I don't know how much your dad has told you about the study, but I'm going to give you some information about it now and then. You can let me know if you're okay with going ahead with it.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:00:08.150,00:00:18.739
Yes.,Adam Sayer,00:00:18.740,00:00:19.110
"That sound good? Yes, so I'll just share my screen. Give me 2 seconds. Okay, so you should be able to see",Chloe Bilverstone,00:00:19.110,00:00:26.990
my screen. Now.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:00:27.100,00:00:28.620
"Yeah. So I'm just going to read sort of read this out to you, but you can read it as well if you like, so essentially as you probably know, I go to a university in London, and I'm in a team looking at testing a new game. That is, we're hoping will help us understand parent and adolescent. So sort of children between the ages of 11 and 15, their relationships and communication.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:00:29.510,00:00:50.039
"So the study will involve you playing an online game with your dad today for 8 min, we're going to use Zoom to record a video of you playing the game doesn't require any gaming skill. The rules are very simple, and I'll explain them to you before we start in terms of the information you give us. Like, I said, the video will just be kept safe and secure, and no one outside of the research team will see your video.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:00:50.740,00:01:16.629
"You don't have to take part. It's completely up to you. You can let me know if you've got any questions. And yeah, if you do want to take part, we can get going.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:01:16.630,00:01:24.900
"Oh, yeah.",Adam Sayer,00:01:24.900,00:01:25.820
"Yeah, you're happy with it.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:01:25.820,00:01:27.379
Go for it.,Adam Sayer,00:01:27.380,00:01:28.130
"So I will stop sharing my screen now, and I'm gonna just put in the chat a link to the game.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:01:28.350,00:01:33.620
If it gives me 2 secs.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:01:33.880,00:01:36.950
"You won't do it, do you?",Adam Sayer,00:01:37.800,00:01:39.899
"Okay, right? So.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:01:40.632,00:01:42.830
So.,Adam Sayer,00:01:44.810,00:01:45.390
It is normally the kids doing it. The parents just have to sit.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:01:45.390,00:01:50.460
Depressing.,Adam Sayer,00:01:50.460,00:01:51.180
"Well, I don't know.",Adam Sayer,00:01:51.400,00:01:52.400
Yeah. And so you click either keyboard or touch screen depending on what device your,Chloe Bilverstone,00:01:53.170,00:01:59.650
"yeah, is that all opened up.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:00.310,00:02:02.000
"Touch or keyboard, keyboard.",Adam Sayer,00:02:02.000,00:02:03.880
"Yeah. And then, Amelia, you sat on the left.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:04.320,00:02:07.200
Looking at Screamer on the right.,Adam Sayer,00:02:09.560,00:02:11.440
"So, so I think it'll be easier if she's.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:11.700,00:02:13.720
Looking at the screen. I'm on the left.,Adam Sayer,00:02:13.720,00:02:15.380
So it's best. If she sat on the left.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:15.980,00:02:18.159
Yourself on the right.,Adam Sayer,00:02:18.160,00:02:19.420
I can never tell.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:19.781,00:02:21.229
"I can never tell with the Zoom, it sort of reverses it, so I have to ask would just be easier with the keys that you're gonna be using.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:22.590,00:02:30.689
Yeah. So I'm looking at the screen on the right hand side now.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:30.920,00:02:34.652
perfect. So if I just talk you through sort of the rules. So this is the etch a sketch. Have you guys seen etch a sketch before?,Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:34.940,00:02:42.930
Yeah.,Adam Sayer,00:02:43.590,00:02:44.250
So it's basically the same. But online. And you should be able to see a picture on the left.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:44.250,00:02:49.380
Yep.,Adam Sayer,00:02:49.840,00:02:50.370
"Yeah. So we're gonna like you to copy that picture onto the etch, a sketch by working together. But there are some rules.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:02:50.370,00:02:56.960
Thank you,Adam Sayer,00:02:56.960,00:02:57.350
"so not hard rules. So, Adam, you can only draw lines that are vertical. So up and down by pressing the O. And M. Keys.",Adam Sayer,00:02:57.350,00:03:05.839
Yep.,Adam Sayer,00:03:05.880,00:03:06.730
"And then, Amelia, you can only make horizontal lines, so go in side by side by pressing the A and D keys, and the important thing to remember is, you're not allowed to touch each other's keys.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:03:06.730,00:03:16.450
Oh!,Adam Sayer,00:03:17.060,00:03:17.900
"Yeah, so Adam O. And M. Keys and Amelia A and D keys if you want to, at any point, you can clear it and start over, so there should be a.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:03:18.740,00:03:27.819
And shake it.,Adam Sayer,00:03:27.820,00:03:28.830
"That would be quite cool, actually.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:03:30.670,00:03:32.050
"That way. It is, yeah.",Adam Sayer,00:03:32.050,00:03:33.150
"Yeah, but no, it's a bit more boring option. So there's a should be a button at the top right.",Chloe Bilverstone,00:03:33.150,00:03:37.060
"Yeah, yeah.",Adam Sayer,00:03:37.060,00:03:38.010
"Yeah, that'll become clickable. You'll play for 8 min. And I will meet myself. Hide my videos so I won't hopefully distract you, but I am here. If you need anything. If you've got any",Chloe Bilverstone,00:03:38.010,00:03:47.951
If you are finished before the time is up. If you could just sort of keep playing so just restart it again. We just essentially want you to be playing for the full 8 min.,Adam Sayer,00:03:49.020,00:03:56.040
"Yeah, no worries.",Adam Sayer,00:03:56.040,00:03:56.909
I'll speak to you to tell you when the time is up. And then that's the only part we use for our research. I'll stop recording at that point.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:03:56.910,00:04:02.410
No worries.,Adam Sayer,00:04:02.410,00:04:03.030
Is everything clear? Do you have any questions?,Chloe Bilverstone,00:04:03.342,00:04:05.840
"No, it should be all right, should we?",Adam Sayer,00:04:05.840,00:04:07.240
"Yeah, are you able to share your screen?",Chloe Bilverstone,00:04:07.240,00:04:10.059

So the bottom it should be on zoom.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:04:21.620,00:04:25.149
Go back on zoom.,Chloe Bilverstone,00:04:26.250,00:04:27.680
